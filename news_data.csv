They have also warned Harris to sharpen her economic messaging, the report notes, with fears spreading that Trump has done well to court the state’s working class voters.Harris has struggled to distance herself from past positions that remain unpopular in the so-called "Blue Wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, including her previous support for transitioning fully to zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 and a ban on fracking.Those concerns were also highlighted by an internal poll shared with the Wall Street Journal that was conducted by Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s campaign that showed Harris down by three points in Wisconsin, another key Midwestern state with similar voting habits to Michigan."The big thing is people don’t know her—they need to see more of her," former Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, a Democrat, told the Wall Street Journal.FIREFIGHTERS UNION PRAISED FOR 'SIGNIFICANT NON-ENDORSEMENT' AFTER BACKING BIDEN IN 2020: 'HUGE WIN FOR TRUMP'Republicans believe that is because Harris has failed in her outreach to the types of workers that have now started gravitating toward Trump.National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital that Harris’ message does not "resonate with working class voters" such as those in the upper Midwest, something that could also help down-ballot Republicans in the critical swing states.Harris’ struggles have also extended to union members, a group that has long been a stronghold for Democrats in the state. However, an internal poll conducted by Teamsters, one of the country’s largest and most influential unions, found that members in Michigan preferred Trump (61.7%) over Harris (35.2%), while national union leaders declined to make an endorsement in this year’s presidential race, despite supporting President Biden’s campaign in 2020.Harris also failed to gain the support of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which also supported Biden in 2020, though she did gain the support of both United Auto Workers and the Service Employees International Union.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"The Teamsters' own polling shows exactly what we knew - that rank and file Michigan Teamsters are supporting President Trump and his pro-worker policies," LaCivita said.

122,"Haitian migration into US becomes major political issue as election looms","The influx of Haitian migrants into the U.S. has become a major political issue in recent months, as both former President Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance repeated claims about the impact they are having on towns like Springfield, Ohio. It has become a political issue in part due to the Biden administration’s parole processes for four nationalities -- Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Under that program, migrants can arrive in the United States and be given a two-year parole term, along with temporary work permits.Some of those are eligible for protection from deportation by the redesignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status by the Biden administration this summer. MAYORKAS MOVES TO SHIELD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FROM DEPORTATION BACK TO TROUBLED CARIBBEAN NATIONThe Biden administration announced on Friday that it will not be extending those parole periods for any of the four nationalities, meaning they will have to apply for a different immigration status or leave the country.The impact that the influx of migrants has had on some towns in the U.S. has become a 2024 election issue after it was put into the spotlight by former President Trump. Most notably, Trump repeated claims that migrants have been eating cats and dogs in Springfield Ohio, which officials have denied. "In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats," Trump said. "They're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame."But others have pointed to the impact it has had on social services.Vance recently said that he does not consider those who come through via the parole programs to be legal immigrants as he sees the programs as illegal. Here is what to know about Haitian migration into the U.S.VANCE SAYS HE WILL KEEP CALLING HAITIAN MIGRANTS ‘ILLEGAL ALIENS’ DESPITE PAROLE STATUS   There are approximately 1,152,604 Haitian immigrants residing in the US according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 American Community Survey (ACS).That is up from nearly 731,000 Haitian immigrants in 2022.Florida has the largest Haitian population in the U.S., at about 511,621 individuals, while New York's population is a distant 2nd with 196,698 individuals. Massachusetts has 72,677 and New Jersey has 69,069.The top four counties for Haitian immigrants were Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties in Florida, and Kings County in New York. Together, these counties accounted for 41 percent of Haitian immigrants in the United States.Meanwhile, in Springfield, officials estimate that between 12,000 and 20,000 Haitians live in the city.More broadly on the CHNV program, during an eight-month period from January through August 2023, roughly 200,000 migrants flew into the U.S. via the program from all four nationalities. Of those, 80% of them, (161,562) arrived in the state of Florida in four cities: Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa Bay, according to DHS data obtained via a subpoena by the House Homeland Security Committee and provided to Fox News.The Biden administration expanded the CHNV program to include Haitians in January 2023 and since then, 214,000 Haitians have entered the U.S. under the program. Recipients are given a two-year parole and a work permit if they have a sponsor and pass certain background checks.However, the administration announced this month that it will not be extending those paroles beyond that period, meaning Haitians and others protected under the program will have to find another immigration status or potentially leave the country.The Biden administration, however, has also redesignated and extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which protects designated migrant groups from deportation and allows work permits, until February 2026. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISISTo be eligible, Haitians must have been in the U.S. as of June 3. DHS predicts that it will allow an estimated 309,000 additional nationals to file for TPS, on top of those already protected.TPS grants protection to nationals in countries found to be unsafe for them to be returned and is based on three grounds: armed ongoing conflict, environmental disasters or "extraordinary and temporary conditions." "Several regions in Haiti continue to face violence or insecurity, and many have limited access to safety, health care, food, and water. Haiti is particularly prone to flooding and mudslides, and often experiences significant damage due to storms, flooding, and earthquakes. These overlapping humanitarian challenges have resulted in ongoing urgent humanitarian needs," DHS said in a release.It has led to concerns from conservatives that the revoking of parole status will not lead to significant numbers of Haitians leaving the U.S. after their status expires.",10-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haitian-migration-us-becomes-major-political-issue-election-looms,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
123,"NC lawmaker accuses Mayorkas of politicizing 'tragedy for personal gain' after FEMA funding alarms","A Republican congressman from hard-hit North Carolina is accusing Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of playing politics with Hurricane Helene after the storm ravaged the Southeast and killed more than 230 people.Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., implored his district’s residents to not believe "outrageous rumors" about the response to the storm in an open letter published Tuesday. "[Federal Emergency Management Agency] FEMA officials have repeatedly affirmed that the agency has enough money for immediate response and recovery needs over the next few months," Edwards wrote. "Secretary Mayorkas’ statement indicating otherwise was an irresponsible attempt to politicize a tragedy for personal gain."He also defended FEMA from "outrageous rumors" that disaster funds were being diverted to help illegal immigrants, and that aid was being blocked from reaching its destination.TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M"We have seen a level of support that is unmatched by most any other disaster nationwide; but amidst all of the support, we have also seen an uptick in untrustworthy sources trying to spark chaos by sharing hoaxes, conspiracy theories, and hearsay about hurricane response efforts across our mountains," Edwards wrote.It comes after Mayorkas warned last week that FEMA did not have the funds to make it through the current hurricane season, spurring alarm across the country.Mayorkas was forced to clarify those comments during the same conversation with reporters, stating FEMA had funding to meet its "immediate needs."The comments were met with skepticism by GOP leaders after Congress made $20 billion in FEMA funds available in federal funding legislation last month, and it exacerbated tensions as some North Carolina residents are already struggling with adequate supplies and aid.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., suggested to Fox News Digital last week that the House would act on additional disaster aid as soon as possible but noted it likely will not be possible until November, when Congress returns after the election. FOX CORPORATION LAUNCHES DONATION DRIVE FOR AMERICAN RED CROSS HURRICANE HELENE RELIEF EFFORTSEdwards said in his letter that he was already helping prepare a supplemental funding bill for when the time comes.The funding woes also prompted some Republicans to point to a separate FEMA-run program that provides support to illegal immigrants at the border, questioning whether the roughly $1 billion allocated there over the last two fiscal years was taken from money for disaster relief.However, Edwards unequivocally denied that in his Tuesday letter, despite top Republicans like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., promoting the claim.HURRICANE HELENE: NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AS BASIC GOODS BECOME SCARCE"Disaster response efforts and individual assistance are funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts," Edwards said. "FEMA’s non-disaster related presence at the border has always been of major concern to me, even before Hurricane Helene, and I will continue to condemn their deployment of personnel to the southern border, but we must separate the two issues."Edwards admitted FEMA had "shortfalls" in its response but denied the federal agency was seizing private property or providing only $750 to disaster survivors, claims that were spread on the internet by unverified sources.He also said FEMA was not conducting road closures or vehicle inspections, nor was it restricting airspace for rescue operations."Nobody seeking to fly resources into Western North Carolina will be prohibited from doing so by the FAA or North Carolina Emergency Management so long as they coordinate their efforts with NC Aviation," Edwards wrote.It comes after Elon Musk spread rumors that FEMA was blocking the distribution of supplies and that airspace was blocked amid his efforts to distribute Starlink internet connections.Edwards also assured that Hurricane Helene "was NOT geoengineered by the government," noting, "Nobody can control the weather."That came in response to online conspiracy theories that the federal government intentionally created the hurricane to take control of the area's lithium mines.The DHS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",10-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nc-lawmaker-accuses-mayorkas-politicizing-tragedy-personal-gain-after-fema-funding-alarms,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Natural Disasters"
124,"Former law enforcement officers, military vets step up to save stranded hurricane survivors without FEMA","Americans with backgrounds in the military and law enforcement have stepped up to help save hurricane survivors in North Carolina without the assistance of the federal government."FEMA's out of money. They just announced it. … We've got money to put everywhere else on the globe — this administration does — but we don't have the money inside of FEMA, a federal emergency management, to help our citizens here in the United States," Aaron Negherbon, founder and CEO of Cops Direct, told Fox News Digital.The comments come as relief efforts continue in North Carolina, a state with widespread devastation from Hurricane Helene.NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON ‘HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATEBut those efforts have also become a political hot potato as the election nears, with critics widely panning the federal government’s response to the natural disaster."They’re offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away," former President Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend. "And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They’re offering them $750. They’ve been destroyed. These people have been destroyed."The criticism came after Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned last week that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) "does not have the funds to make it through" the hurricane season, prompting a stopgap measure by lawmakers to replenish the agency’s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) with $20 billion, according to a report from National Public Radio.Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris has argued critics of the administration’s response have been pushing "disinformation.""There’s a lot of mis- and disinformation being pushed out there by the former president about what is available, in particular to the survivors of Helene," Harris said. "It’s extraordinarily irresponsible: It’s about him, it’s not about you. And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them."Negherbon said his and other organizations have opted to "step in and aid our fellow Americans when they need help."RESIDENTS IN KEY NORTH CAROLINA DISTRICT REVEAL HOW THEY THINK THEIR COUNTY WILL VOTE IN NOVEMBER"I can tell you that my phones are ringing, and my email is chiming all day long because of the requests from agencies that need our support," he said. "One jurisdiction, one county, one community is hearing about what Cops Direct is doing, and, all of a sudden, they're telling the next county over and, therefore, our phone is ringing."One way Cops Direct and others have been helping is by flying much needed emergency supplies to residents who have been cut off by the storm with many roads and traditional paths to homes being washed away and inaccessible.Ross Johnson, owner of TacMed, a company that makes emergency medical supplies for use on the battlefield and for law enforcement, told Fox News Digital he used his skill as a pilot and a vast network of other pilots to help rush supplies to those affected by using helicopters."There was no way to get anywhere. So I said, 'Hey, let's see what we can do,'" Johnson, a former Army Green Beret who served three tours in Afghanistan, said.Johnson said FEMA has not been operating in the same areas he has been helping, though he noted that the agency is likely helping in other places."I'm not saying they're not doing anything. I'm sure they have a role. And we know that they're a big organization that has a response time. … It takes time to move that machine," he said.Instead, Johnson said he has focused his efforts on areas where his skill as a pilot can be most beneficial."We're in the mountains," Johnson said. "Places accessible by helicopter."Johnson also noted the people undertaking the effort to assist those in North Carolina are volunteering their time and effort and their own resources in hopes of making a difference for those who have had their lives upended by the natural disaster."It really is people that just want to do good. You know, we're locals. We know the area. These are our neighbors, and we have a way to help them. And that's what we're trying to do," he said. "We're not Uber Eats. … We aren't making money on this. We're just a couple of guys with access to some assets that are the right tool for this job, at least at this point in time."The White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.",10-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-law-enforcement-military-vets-step-up-save-stranded-hurricane-survivors-without-fema,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Natural Disasters"
125,"Political storm: Back-to-back hurricanes rock Harris-Trump presidential campaign","President Biden made calls with elected officials in Florida on Wednesday evening, as powerful and extremely dangerous Hurricane Milton crashed into the state.The president also spoke with Democratic and Republican senators from the states hard hit by Hurricane Helene, which tore a path of destruction through the southeast nearly two weeks ago."I directed my team to do everything we can to save lives and help communities before, during, and after the hurricane -- the one that has just passed and this awful one that’s about to hit," Biden said at the end of a long day overseeing the federal response to the storms. And, the president stressed that "my most important message today is for those who are in impacted areas, please, please listen to your local authorities, follow all safety…instructions and evacuation orders. This is serious, very serious."BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDAWith less than four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump locked in a narrow margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene — North Carolina and Georgia — among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election, the politics of federal disaster relief are again front and center on the campaign trail.Trump for nearly two weeks has repeatedly attacked Biden and Harris and accused them of being incompetent in steering the federal efforts in responding to the back-to-back deadly hurricanes.EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE"The worst hurricane response since Katrina," the former president charged on Wednesday as he pointed to the much-maligned initial federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was heavily criticized for being slow and ineffective.Trump, speaking at a campaign rally in battleground Pennsylvania, lobbed another political bomb at Harris, arguing that "She just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina…the worst ever, they say."And the former president once again made false claims that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) diverted money intended for disaster relief and spent it on undocumented migrants in the U.S. as he turned up the volume on his inflammatory rhetoric over the combustible issue of illegal immigration."You know where they gave the money to: illegal immigrants coming," Trump said as the crowd of MAGA supporters loudly booed.Trump's attacks have continued even as top Republicans in the states impacted by the storms - including Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida - complimented the federal assistance.CLICK HERE FOR UP-TO-DATE FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE STORMSA couple of hours earlier, as the president and vice president received their latest briefing from FEMA and other federal agencies on storm preparations in Florida and relief efforts across the Southeast, Biden said that "we have made available an unprecedented number of assets to deal with this crisis, and we’re going to continue to do so until the job is done."Biden also took aim at Trump, accusing him of leading an "onslaught of lies."The president charged that the rhetoric from Trump and other Republicans was "beyond ridiculous" and that "it’s got to stop."Harris, who in July replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, had a similar message during an interview Wednesday on the Weather Channel."This is not a time for us to just point fingers at each other as Americans," Harris said. "Anybody who considers themselves to be a leader should really be in the business right now of giving people a sense of confidence that we're all working together and that we have the resources and the ability to work together on their behalf."HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTONBut earlier this week, Harris and DeSantis traded verbal fire over whether he ignored hurricane-related calls from her.The vice president called DeSantis "selfish," and the governor accused Harris of playing "political games.""Natural disasters present perils and promise for presidential hopefuls," longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed, a veteran of multiple GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News.Reed noted that "for the incumbent, it’s an opportunity to demonstrate competence and steady leadership and prove that their government is able to function at a core level during a time of peril."But it doesn't always play according to the script for an incumbent president.Then-President George H.W. Bush took a political hit over FEMA's disorganized efforts to provide relief in Florida from Hurricane Andrew, which pounded the then-key battleground state weeks before the 1992 election.Fast-forward a decade and his son - then-President George W. Bush - enjoyed a political bounce in Florida during his 2004 re-election thanks to his aggressive response to Hurricane Charley, which hit in August of that year.Bush was narrowly re-elected, thanks in large part to carrying the Sunshine State, but his administration's image in handling storms took a major hit the next year, over the botched response in Louisiana to Hurricane Katrina.As he ran for re-election in 2012, then-President Barack Obama's aggressive response in dealing with Superstorm Sandy -which slammed into the Eastern Seaboard days before the election - likely boosted him to victory.Reed argued that "without a real role to play in the response to Helene and now Milton, Vice President Harris is betwixt and between, wary about being seen as too close to a deeply unpopular administration but also well aware that its failures will be seen as her failures and political baggage to carry the next three weeks."Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.",10-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/political-storm-back-to-back-hurricanes-rock-harris-trump-presidential-campaign,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Natural Disasters"
126,"Trump counters Harris media blitz by ripping Bob Woodward, Howard Stern and her hurricane briefing","On one point, at least, the Kremlin has sided with Bob Woodward against former President Donald Trump.Woodward is coming out with a new book, and among its headline-making disclosures is his report on what happened when the pandemic struck, when the death toll was soaring and people could not get home testing kits for COVID-19.FROM KISSY-FACE SITDOWN ON ‘THE VIEW’ TO A TOUGHER GRILLING ON ‘60 MINUTES,’ KAMALA HARRIS IS MAKING NEWSTrump, at that point in 2020, secretly sent Vladimir Putin a number of Abbott Point of Care COVID test machines "for his personal use."The Trump campaign said Woodward’s book, an advance copy of which was obtained by CNN, consisted entirely of made-up stories.However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov confirmed the receipt of the COVID machines."As for the tests, when the pandemic began, countries did not have enough equipment," Peskov said. "And many countries then exchanged such gestures of support and sent each other shipments of various equipment they had." In fact, during the spring of 2020, Russia sent the Trump administration 60 tons of medical equipment.Woodward also quotes the Russian dictator as telling Trump, "I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don’t care about me."KAMALA 2.0’S CHALLENGE? MAKING MORE NEWS, AND NOT JUST WITH ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOSTSHowever, Peskov disputed another assertion by Woodward, that Trump has stayed in touch with Putin since he left the White House, with as many as seven calls between them. "As for the calls, that's a lie," Peskov said.  In the book "War," however, the Washington Post sleuth recounts a scene where Trump tells a top aide to leave the room so "he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin." Trump officials now say they are not aware of any such conversations.The former president granted Woodward 18 taped interviews for his previous book, but they had a falling out after the veteran reporter wrote that Trump was unfit for office and was sued by his subject for releasing the recordings.I know Woodward’s work extremely well, and while any journalist can be misled by sources, he does not make things up.Other parts of the book deal with President Biden confronting Putin about the coming invasion of Ukraine, had Vice President Kamala Harris warn a skeptical Volodomyr Zelenskyy, and – with officials assuming a 50% chance that he might use a tactical nuclear weapon against the Ukrainians, called the Kremlin boss the "epitome of evil."  The president repeatedly cursed out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu, calling him an "SOB" and, later, a "f---ing liar" after the Israeli prime minister invaded the crowded area called Rafah despite American pressure.WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESSIn the statement from Trump’s spokesman, which sounds like it was dictated by the boss, Woodward is described as "a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Woodward is an angry, little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously. President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue. Woodward is a total sleazebag who has lost it mentally, and he’s slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality."Why stop there?Trump, who prides himself on being a counter-puncher, wastes little time before swinging away.After Harris’ friendly radio interview with Howard Stern, who said it would be insanity to vote for Trump, a post appeared on Truth Social."BETA MALE Howard Stern made a fool of himself on his low-rated radio show when he ‘interviewed’ Lyin’ Kamala Harris, and hit her with so many SOFTBALL questions that even she was embarrassed."He looked like a real fool, working so hard to make a totally incompetent and ill-equipped person look as good as possible, which wasn’t very good. I dropped Howard a long time ago, like most others, and have since been credited with very good judgment!" Trump and Stern were, of course, once New York pals, and Trump attended his wedding. Trump also had campaign manager Chris LaCivita take a swipe at Fox News for covering (along with other networks) a government briefing, featuring both Biden and Harris, on Hurricane Milton as the monster storm was heading toward Florida. "@FoxNews ⁩just as bad as every other ‘cable news’ network …running literally propaganda and @KamalaHarris ⁩TV ads disguised as a news conference," Chris LaCivita posted on X.

128,"In Arizona speech, Vance says next president must put Americans first, slams FEMA money for migrants","Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, rallied supporters in Tucson, Arizona, on Wednesday, the same day early voting began in the battleground state. The Republican vice presidential nominee's message Wednesday underscored the Trump campaign's "America First" agenda, insisting to rallygoers that putting Americans first is the essence of why politicians exist in the first place. "This country ought to work for the American people and the American people first," Vance said. "We can have compassion for people … by all means, we ought to be compassionate. But you know who our leaders owe compassion to most and above all? It's American citizens. We ought to focus on our own people and put their interests first."ARIZONA BEGINS IN-PERSON AND ABSENTEE VOTING, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWVance pointed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) administration of funds to migrants for housing and relocation purposes. The roughly $1.7 billion was approved by members on both sides of the aisle in Congress and allowed a slice of FEMA's funding to go to helping states and localities deal with the ongoing migrant crisis.Simultaneously, FEMA's disaster relief fund, which is entirely separate from the program helping migrants, has continued to receive funding to the tune of nearly $244 billion, ProPublica reported.  "Disaster relief ought to go to prepare and to respond to a disaster when it strikes American territory. Our government has got to focus on our citizens, put their interests first, take care of American citizens when a disaster hits," Vance said. "Unfortunately, under Kamala Harris' leadership, you've got FEMA, which is doing resettlement and relocation for illegal immigration."FEMA should take care of American citizens when a disaster strikes. That's all it should be doing. And when Donald Trump and I are back in office, that's all it's going to do."SWING STATE GOP CHAIR SLAMS BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN FOR BEING OUT OF TOUCH ON KEY ISSUE: ‘ABANDONED THIS COUNTRY’At Wednesday's rally, held at Tucson Speedway, Vance was joined by his wife, Usha; Robert O'Brien, former national security adviser under Trump; Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley; and Arizona GOP Chair Gina Swoboda.Vance implored people to get out and vote early if they have to, despite past criticisms from both him and Trump about early voting. He hearkened back to 2020, when, according to Vance, people who were going to vote for Trump on Election Day could not because of unforeseen circumstances.NEW POLL REVEALS WHICH VOTER GROUP ARE FUELING TRUMP TO A NARROW EDGE OVER HARRIS IN BATTLEGROUND  "I don't like election season. I like Election Day. But we are where we are, my friends," Vance said. "We've got an election season, and if the Democrats are taking advantage of it, we've got to do the exact same thing. So whether you're voting on Election Day, or voting by mail or voting early, get out there and make your voice heard."I talked to a lot of people who planned to vote for Donald Trump in 2020, and 95 out of 100 of them actually went out and voted for Donald Trump. But you talk to the five who didn't vote for Donald Trump, and it's not because they changed their mind, it's because… their kid got sick, so they had to go pick him up from school, or they worked late that night and weren't able to make it to the polls before they closed. The best way to make sure your voice is counted is to make sure it's counted early."A majority of states have already begun early voting by mail and in person.Montana has seen the largest percentage of registered voters request absentee ballots.

129,"Trump charges hurricane response 'worst since Katrina' as Biden argues Trump 'onslaught of lies' must 'stop'","SCRANTON, Pa. — Former President Trump is once again taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over the federal government's response to back-to-back destructive hurricanes that have targeted the Southeast."The worst hurricane response since Katrina," the former president charged as he pointed to the much-maligned initial federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was heavily criticized for being slow and ineffective.Trump, at a campaign event in battleground Pennsylvania, spoke as an extremely powerful and dangerous Hurricane Milton was hours away from slamming into Florida, and as the death toll rises and more than 100,000 people remain without power or running water nearly two weeks after Hurricane Helene tore a path of destruction through the southeastern U.S.BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDAWith less than four weeks to go until Election Day in November, Trump and Harris are locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene — North Carolina and Georgia — among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election, the politics of federal disaster relief are again front and center on the campaign trail.EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACETrump for nearly two weeks has repeatedly attacked Biden and Harris and accused them of being incompetent."THE WORST RESPONSE TO A STORM OR HURRICANE DISASTER IN U.S. HISTORY," Trump claimed in a social media post on Tuesday."She's just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina," Trump charged at his Wednesday campaign event, as he lobbed another political bomb at the vice president. "The worst ever, they say."And the former president once again made false claims that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) diverted money intended for disaster relief and spent it on undocumented migrants in the U.S. as he turned up the volume on his inflammatory rhetoric over the combustible issue of illegal immigration."You know where they gave the money to: illegal immigrants coming," Trump said as the crowd of MAGA supporters loudly booed.CLICK HERE FOR UP-TO-DATE FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE STORMSA couple of hours earlier, as the president and vice president received their latest briefing from FEMA and other federal agencies on storm preparations in Florida and relief efforts across the Southeast, Biden said that "we have made available an unprecedented number of assets to deal with this crisis, and we’re going to continue to do so until the job is done."And the president had a message for his predecessor in the White House."Over the last few weeks, there has been a reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies that are disturbing people. It’s undermining confidence in the incredible rescue and recovery work that has already been taken and will continue to be taken, and it’s harmful to those who need help the most. There is simply no place for this to happen," he said.HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTONPointing to the Republican presidential nominee, Biden said that "former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies. Assertions have been made that property is being confiscated. That’s simply not true."Biden said rhetoric from Trump and other Republicans was "beyond ridiculous" and that "it’s got to stop.""In moments like this, there are no red or blue states. There’s one United States of America, where neighbors are helping neighbors. Volunteers and first responders are risking everything, including their own lives, to help their fellow Americans; state, local and federal officials are standing side by side," the president said.Harris, who in July replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, had a similar message during an interview Wednesday on the Weather Channel."This is not a time for us to just point fingers at each other as Americans," Harris said. "Anybody who considers themselves to be a leader should really be in the business right now of giving people a sense of confidence that we're all working together and that we have the resources and the ability to work together on their behalf, on behalf of the people of our country. And that's what I'm focused on."Earlier this week, Harris and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida traded fire over whether he ignored hurricane-related calls from her.But when it comes to the federal response, DeSantis, along with other Republican governors in the storm-affected region, had no complaints about the federal assistance.The governor reiterated those comments Tuesday morning in an interview on "FOX and Friends.""Every request that we’ve made — I’ve been in contact with the president, I’ve been in contact with the FEMA director.

132,"How US government will dole out aid to victims of Hurricanes Milton, Helene","As the second major hurricane this month barrels toward the U.S. – this one promising to be even more devastating than the last – concerns are growing over how the government will help pay for what could become millions of dollars worth of damage.Is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) running out of money? Will Congress approve disaster relief?A Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report from August states that FEMA has $7 billion that can be directed to help with recovery from Hurricanes Milton and Helene.FEMA has a stash of money that was dedicated to recovery from older natural disasters dating back to "Superstorm Sandy," which spun through the Northeast in 2012. But Fox is told the IG report "gives an incomplete picture" of how much money is available. FEMA disputes that all the money is recoverable, signaling that only about $4.5 billion is not obligated and could potentially be reprogrammed.That still means that some money is potentially available and could be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for "immediate needs." The DRF deals with the immediate preparation and aftermath of natural disasters. That includes providing food and shelter for people, rescuing people, providing immediate money to people, transportation, et al. CATEGORY 3 MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDAFox is told that Congress would have to vote to "reprogram" the older money. Moreover, reprogrammed older disaster relief money can only go back into the DRF. It cannot be applied to a larger "supplemental" spending bill to help recover from these storms. The price tag there will likely be upwards of $1 billion. It will be up to Congress to decide if it wants to reprogram some of that money to address immediate needs in the DRF once that pot of money starts to bleed dry after these two major storms. Under the individual assistance program, the agency often quickly approves $750 for each household for food, clothes and everyday essentials. Disaster survivors are also eligible to receive up to $42,500 in financial housing assistance. That can be used to repair homes or pay up to 18 months of rent. Applications for this program tend to take longer for FEMA to process. Other programs offer tens of thousands of dollars to help disaster survivors rebuild through the Small Business Administration, FEMA and other federal programs. Meanwhile, lawmakers freed up roughly $20 billion in immediate funding for FEMA in last month’s short-term federal funding bill. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R–La., predicted Helene’s devastation would be "one of the most expensive" the U.S. has seen.Initial estimates place private insured losses from Helene at around $11 billion. Milton, now rated a Category 3 hurricane, is expected to wreak even more havoc.HURRICANE MILTON: PROTECT YOUR HOME FROM LOOTINGCongress is not expected to return early from a pre-election recess to deal with the problem."The thing about these hurricanes and disasters of this magnitude is that it takes a while to calculate the actual damages, and the states are going to need some time to do that," Johnson said on Fox News.But Fox is increasingly hearing from a number of conservatives who are ready to respond to the financial needs of Hurricanes Milton and Helene. They are happy to spend the money, but they are increasingly itchy about wanting spending cuts to offset the cost of the storm. Some of those requests may be for programs that address Democrat priorities.But a senior House Republican source disagrees that the offsets will ever come."That isn’t going to happen. That never happens," the source said. "This will just go on the credit card."While the idea of cutting elsewhere to produce offsets makes sense, it may be politically impossible."Tell me where you can get the votes to do it?" asked the source, who declined to be identified.Moreover, the federal government is already into fiscal 2025 and there is no agreed-upon top-line spending number. In addition, fiscal hawks tried to make similar cuts after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, but they failed."And it’s not going to work now," the GOP source said.Johnson said he was "alarmed and disappointed" by Biden officials’ comments immediately after the storm suggesting FEMA was too low on funds to deal with Helene’s wrath. Biden suggested this week he may want Congress to return for an emergency session to pass a supplemental disaster aid bill.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said "we are meeting the immediate needs" of the hurricane this week, but "FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season."Criticism over FEMA’s response has prompted some conservatives to accuse the Biden administration of diverting disaster aid funds toward supporting illegal immigrants at the border through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), which was allocated roughly $650 million in the last fiscal year.Both the White House and Department of Homeland Security have vigorously denied any link between disaster aid and the SSP, beyond both being administered by FEMA, and have said claims of any disaster relief dollars being used to support migrant housing services are false.Fox News' Liz Elkind contributed to this report.",09-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-us-government-dole-out-aid-victims-hurricanes-milton-helene,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Natural Disasters"
133,"Trump foe Mitt Romney resists endorsing Harris","Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney won't endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president despite his outspoken criticisms of former President Trump. "I’ve made it very clear that I don’t want Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States," Romney said Tuesday at the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah, The New York Times reported.  "I want to continue to have a voice in the Republican Party following this election. I think there’s a good chance that the Republican Party is going to need to be rebuilt or reoriented," he later added during the political forum. Romney announced last year that he would not seek re-election as a senator representing the Beehive State, and will leave office in January. The Republican has long criticized Trump, and indicated in June that he was unlikely to support the 45th president's re-election. 'TRAITOR' LIZ CHENEY WALLOPED BY WYOMING VOTERS FOR HARRIS ENDORSEMENT, BREAK WITH GOP"With President Trump, it’s a matter of personal character," Romney told CNN at the time. "I draw a line and say when someone has been actually found to have been sexually assaulted, that’s something I just won’t cross over in the person I wouldn't want to have as president of the United States." Romney's comments referred to a federal jury’s decision in New York City last year, which ruled Trump was not liable for the rape of E. Jean Carroll, though the former president was liable for sexual abuse and defamation.KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTYRomney has also slammed Trump for Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of the then-president breached the U.S. Capitol, arguing Trump incited an insurrection due to his "injured pride" over the 2020 election. Romney subsequently was one of seven Republican members of the Senate who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6. NIKKI HALEY DEFENDS TRUMP SUPPORT AFTER BEING CALLED OUT BY LIZ CHENEY: 'THIS IS ABOUT AMERICA'Romney was also the only Republican who voted to impeach Trump in 2020 over abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges. Trump was acquitted in both impeachment cases, and is the only president in history who was impeached twice and acquitted twice. Trump has also hit back at Romney, saying in 2020 that the Utah senator "can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency," referring to his 2012 bid for the White House, and calling him a "disgrace" that same year for voting to impeach. While Romney has previously broken with the GOP on other key issues, he indicated Tuesday that he will not offer his endorsement to Harris despite other Republicans recently throwing their support behind the vice president. Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney officially endorsed Harris last week and joined her on the campaign trail in Wisconsin, while former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake also endorsed Harris. Fox News Digital reached out to Romney's office for additional comment on the matter, but did not immediately receive a reply.

The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt," Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, along with Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided President Biden's 2020 White House victory over Trump. And the seven states are likely to determine if Trump or Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are also the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called "Blue Wall."The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states by razor-thin margins to put them back in the Democrats' column and defeat Trump.Both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, as well as their running mates, have made repeated stops in the three states this summer.Trump is holding campaign events on Wednesday in Scranton and Reading, Pennsylvania. And Harris returns to Pennsylvania early next week for a stop in Erie.Both candidates have also campaigned in Michigan and Wisconsin over the past few days. All three states are also holding crucial Senate elections that will likely determine if the GOP wins back the chamber's majority.In Pennsylvania, the Quinnipiac University poll indicates Democratic Sen. Bob Casey leads Republican challenger Dave McCormick 51% to 43%.According to the survey, in the race to succeed Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and former Rep. Mike Rogers are deadlocked at 48%.And in Wisconsin, Democratic Sen.

135,"Harris risks losing crucial battleground state due to Biden's gas export pause, as Dems plead to change course","Vice President Kamala Harris is facing growing pressure from within her own party to lift the Biden administration's pause on liquified natural gas (LNG) exports amid growing fears that the moratorium could cost the Democratic Party presidential nominee the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania — a natural gas powerhouse.Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes are considered critical to winning the White House. Its reputation as a slightly left-leaning swing state, which former President Donald Trump carried by a razor-thin margin of just 0.7% in 2016, is complicated somewhat by its status as a major producer of fossil fuels."It's obvious that the pathway to the presidency goes through Pennsylvania," Amanda Eversole, the chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute, told Fox News Digital.FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN PENNSYLVANIAThe chorus of Democrats now criticizing the moratorium is something of an about-face from January, when the Biden administration first ordered its temporary halt on new LNG exports, citing a need to better evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of such projects. Now, nine months later and less than a month away from Election Day, Harris is under pressure from some Democrat lawmakers and industry leaders to lift the pause completely.Critics of the pause argue that removing or delaying U.S. LNG supplies from the market deprives European buyers of a cleaner, lower-emission form of energy — forcing some countries to turn to Russian gas or coal instead. It could also affect U.S. relationships, American energy leadership and investments in massive domestic projects in the years ahead.Pennsylvania is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the U.S., behind Texas. Its gas reserves are contained behind shale rock and must be extracted by fracking — a technology viewed as controversial at best by many on the left and one that Harris has only recently endorsed.FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: THE BIGGEST SURPRISES COME AFTER OCTOBERThe fossil fuel industry supports more than 423,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, and contributes more than $75 billion to its economy, according to estimates from PwC. Therefore, the future of the LNG industry carries outsize importance to most voters, industry group leaders and former DOE officials told Fox News in a series of interviews.In fact, Pennsylvania's Democratic Senate delegation, Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman, were among the first lawmakers to criticize the LNG pause following Biden's announcement earlier this year. Their counterparts in the House have also followed suit as they seek reelection in competitive districts.Meanwhile, Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate hoping to flip Casey's seat this fall, has lambasted the Democrat incumbent for failing to do enough to protect energy interests in the state. A spokesperson for Casey's office pointed Fox News to the senator's earlier letters and remarks opposing the LNG pause.A recent poll published by API this month found that 85% of voters in Pennsylvania wanted to hear more from both Harris and Trump about their energy polices.To date, Harris has declined to comment on whether she will lift the LNG pause, and neither the campaign nor the White House responded to Fox News’ requests for comment.FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTEIf Harris does intend to break with Biden or push for an end to the pause and unleash more production, API's Eversole said Harris needs to make that clear — and fast."If she, in fact, is going to be different from the Biden administration," Eversole said, "then specifically how?"Rhetoric, she said, is not enough. Especially when private investors in the U.S. have also backed out of some projects in recent months, citing regulatory uncertainty."We need to get shovels in the ground," Eversole said. "We need to be able to build more infrastructure, can move safely, move our product, and we need to be able to make long-lived investments."",09-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-risks-losing-crucial-battleground-state-due-bidens-gas-export-pause-dems-plead-change-course,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,Others

Michigan figures to play a key role in determining the eventual winner, having narrowly gone for former President Donald Trump in 2016 before another close race swung the state to President Biden in 2020.MELANIA TRUMP ADMITS SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S SAFETY AS NOVEMBER ELECTION LOOMS: 'TOXIC ATMOSPHERE'The 2024 version of the race is shaping up to be close again, with the Real Clear Politics polling average showing Vice President Kamala Harris with a slim 0.5 point lead over Trump as of Wednesday.Wayne County, which includes Detroit and is Michigan’s most populous county, could play a key role in determining who emerges with the victory in the state. While the county has traditionally supported Democratic candidates, Republicans have made inroads with voters in Wayne County since Trump’s 2016 campaign. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, captured just over 26% of the vote in the county during his 2012 campaign, while the late Sen. John McCain was only able to capture just under 25% during his 2008 White House bid. But Trump has performed better during his two runs, garnering over 29% and over 30% of the vote in Wayne County in 2016 and 2020.The Trump campaign is hoping its appeal to working class voters will help it make even more inroads with Wayne County voters, a strategy that Vance is at the center of."I think that JD Vance is an incredible statesman, effective communicator," one voter attending the rally told Fox News Digital, adding that the Ohio Senator’s Ohio roots also help shore "up support in the Midwestern states."HOWARD STERN TELLS HARRIS SUN WILL 'GO OUT' IF SHE LOSES: 'WE'RE IN FOR THE DARKEST SKIES ON THE PLANET'"He kind of gets the concerns of the country people. Smart as a whip. He knows tech," the voter said."Absolutely, even though Ohio and Michigan have a rivalry," another voter said when asked if Vance’s roots help him in Michigan. "I know that the Midwest Rust Belt states feel very strongly about Vance and of course about Trump.""JD Vance is a gentleman. He’s energetic. He certainly is a patriot. He served in the Marines for four years... He’s really proved that he is a true American," the voter added."I don’t know about them U of M fans. I don’t know how deep that Buckeye traditions go," another voter quipped, adding that at the end of the day he believes people from Ohio and Michigan are similar and that they will "come together."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOther voters in Detroit praised Vance’s demeanor, arguing that he provided a contrast to his more brash running mate. "He is very well balanced and he’s younger, and he comes from a different upbringing than Trump," a voter told Fox News Digital. "He’s engaging… He’s got great points.""JD Vance brings us a lot of great common-sense thinking. He can formulate his answers a lot better than I could," another voter said.

137,"Trump vs Harris Round 2? Voters in key GA county reveal if they want second debate","MARIETTA, Ga. – Americans living in the Atlanta suburbs appear to have little appetite for another primetime match-up between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris."If you don’t know them by now, there ain’t no hope," one man who declined to give his name told Fox News Digital in Acworth, Georgia, last week.There is less than a month left until Election Day, and Georgia residents are bracing for early voting to begin in their state next week.The Peach State is in play this election after President Biden flipped it blue for the first time in years during the 2020 race, winning over Trump by less than 1%.GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATEA not insignificant amount of that support came from Cobb County, Georgia, where Biden won by an even wider margin than he did statewide.And like Biden and Trump in 2020, the ex-president and Harris have only had one debate.Trump has refused to participate in a second one, while Harris and her allies are eager for another head-to-head.But people in Cobb County who spoke with Fox News Digital seemed unenthusiastic about the prospect of a second debate."I really don’t think so," Howard Segan, who spoke with Fox News Digital outside of a Marietta Whole Foods, answered when asked if Americans needed another debate. "I don’t think Trump is a very good debater at all.

So what’s there to debate? She can’t even answer questions."Meanwhile, a man in Marietta named Toli said he "honestly" would like to see another debate but saw little value in the exercise."It doesn’t really matter at this point, because people are going to have their own views, no matter what they do," Toli said. "Maybe 20 years ago we had debates where people watched, they were riveted to the screen trying to figure out what their opinions are. But now it’s so polarized.

138,"Biden and Netanyahu speak after report US president called Israeli counterpart a ‘bad f---ing guy’","President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone on Wednesday for the first time in more than 50 days. It came after fresh tensions emerged in their relationship: Netanyahu refused to approve his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s trip to the U.S. on Tuesday until Biden called him. The call came together in short order after that. Netanyahu spoke with former President Trump earlier Wednesday before he spoke with Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the call along with the president. It comes as Israel has been weighing its options to retaliate for the barrage of missiles Iran fired toward the Jewish state last week. Gallant warned on Wednesday the Israeli response was sure to catch Iran by surprise. "As we have shown until now in this war and in all arenas – whoever attacks Israel will pay a price. Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened," he told the IDF's intelligence unit in a briefing. Biden has warned Netanyahu to make sure his response is "proportional" and to avoid hitting Iran’s nuclear facilities. The longtime relationship between the two men soured in the months that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.Further indication of their mutual disdain came on the one-year anniversary of the attacks, when Biden called Israeli President Isaac Herzog over Netanyahu. HOPE FADES FOR A DEAL TO BRING HOSTAGES HOME Since the world leaders’ last call, Israel has launched an aggressive offensive operation in Lebanon, and successfully taken out top Hezbollah leadership over a short timeframe. Israeli airstrikes killed the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and now his successor too, according to Netanyahu.Netanyahu is also known to be distrusting of his defense minister, who he’s tried to fire twice. Gallant has publicly criticized Netanyahu for not articulating a postwar plan for Gaza. In a particularly heated April phone call, Biden asked Netanyahu, "What’s your strategy, man?" according to Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward in his new book, "War." KAMALA HARRIS COURTS DISILLUSIONED ARAB AMERICANS OVER JEWISH VOTERS, RECORDS SHOW Netanyahu, at the time, said Israel had to go into Rafah, a Gaza-Egypt border city, that he claimed to be a Hamas stronghold. "Bibi, you’ve got no strategy," Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, who he also allegedly claimed "doesn’t give a damn" about Hamas and "only about himself."After Israel entered Rafah, Biden said of Netanyahu: "He’s a f---ing liar.""That son of a b----, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy," said Biden privately, according to Woodward. "He’s a bad f---ing guy!"Biden said he felt, in Woodward’s accounting, that Netanyahu "had been lying to him regularly." With Netanyahu "continuing to say he was going to kill every last member of Hamas." Woodward wrote, "Biden had told him that was impossible, threatening both privately and publicly to withhold offensive U.S. weapons shipments."",09-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-netanyahu-speak-after-report-us-president-called-israeli-counterpart-bad-fing-guy,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
139,"Afghan national charged with Election Day terror plot reignites vetting concerns: ‘Glaring alarms’","The arrest of an Afghan national now accused of plotting an Election Day terror attack on behalf of ISIS, and who entered the United States shortly after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, is reigniting long-standing questions and concerns from Republicans about the vetting of those who came to the U.S. at that time.Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi is said to have obtained firearms and ammunition to conduct a violent attack on U.S. soil and took steps to prepare for the plot. Tawhedi, who was arrested on Monday, is charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism. Authorities say he liquidated his family's assets to finance his plan, including purchasing rifles and one-way tickets for his wife and child back to Afghanistan."This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on election day, here on our homeland," said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement. "I am proud of the men and women of the FBI who uncovered and stopped the plot before anyone was harmed. Terrorism is still the FBI's number one priority, and we will use every resource to protect the American people." AFGHAN MAN IN OKLAHOMA PLOTTED ELECTION DAY TERROR ATTACK IN US ON BEHALF OF ISIS, JUSTICE DEPT SAYSAuthorities said Tawhedi entered the United States on Sept. 9, 2021, on a Special Immigrant Visa and is currently on parole status pending adjudication of his immigration proceedings. His alleged co-conspirator is a green card holder who arrived in the U.S. on a Special Immigrant Visa in 2018.Special Immigrant Visas (SIV), made available first during the Bush administration, allowed those who worked with the U.S. armed forces as a translator or interpreter in Afghanistan or Iraq to obtain a visa. The number of SIV applicants increased sharply amid the 2021 withdrawal.But Tawhedi entered shortly after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, a time that saw planes full of Afghans being quickly evacuated from Kabul's airport and tens of thousands of Afghans brought to the U.S. The U.S. would go on to admit more than 97,000 evacuees, of which about 77,000 were admitted via humanitarian parole, through a program called Operation Allies Welcome. It is unclear how Tawhedi entered the U.S. and also why he would have moved from a SIV to a parole status. But Republicans and watchdog officials have long expressed concern about the vetting of those who came in during that period. Those concerns have been renewed in the case of Tawhedi."When tens of thousands of insufficiently vetted individuals are let into the interior, this is the inevitable result," House Homeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green, R-Tenn., said in a statement. "This Committee has repeatedly warned of the terror threats stemming from the Biden-Harris administration's failed leadership and disastrous border security policies. DHS OIG FAULTS AFGHAN VETTING, WARNS NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS MAY HAVE ENTERED US"Unfortunately, our calls for transparency regarding the inadequate vetting and screening following the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan continue to go unanswered – and, here, Americans almost paid the price," he said.In the Senate, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he had been vocal about the need to thoroughly vet SIV applicants but that the Biden administration had been "quick to dismiss those glaring alarms.""The number one job of our government is to protect its citizens. By hiding behind clerical excuses, refusing to take accountability and neglecting to address known vulnerabilities in vetting and resettlement processes, the Biden-Harris administration failed to prioritize Americans’ safety and, once again, projected weakness on the global stage," Grassley said in a statement. House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York also blamed the administration."Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi was flown into the U.S. by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Their catastrophic America Last foreign policy has made America less safe," she said in a statement.Concerns about vetting have been voiced by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) internal watchdog. In 2022, the DHS Office of Inspector General released a report in which it said it found that officials "did not always have critical data to properly screen, vet, or inspect the evacuees."DHS ANNOUNCES TERROR BAR EXEMPTIONS FOR AFGHAN EVACUEES WHO WORKED FOR TALIBAN-ERA CIVIL SERVICE "As a result, DHS may have admitted or paroled individuals into the United States who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities," the report said.A Pentagon inspector general report the same year revealed that at least 50 evacuees were brought to the U.S. whose information indicated "potentially serious security concerns" and that officials were unable to locate dozens with derogatory information.A 2024 report found "vulnerabilities" in the processes of two DHS agencies for resolving derogatory information. It also found that DHS did not have a process for monitoring the expiration of the two-year parole period and guidelines for determining "re-parole" for parolees are "undefined."But the Biden administration has repeatedly defended the vetting process, arguing that there is a multilayered process that includes classified and unclassified vetting, including against Pentagon and FBI databases as well as Interpol notices and other information. It previously pushed back against the 2022 IG report, saying it failed to acknowledge an "unprecedented whole of government effort" and for seeing only one part of the screening process."Afghan evacuees who sought to enter the United States were subject to multi layered screening and vetting against intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism information," a DHS spokesperson said on Wednesday. "If new information emerges after arrival, appropriate action is taken." Officials have noted that vetting is a "point-in-time" check of current information. It is still not clear if there was any derogatory information on Tawhedi  before he arrived.The arrest comes among broader concerns about the potential for terrorism in the U.S. by foreign nationals. Fox News Digital reported on Tuesday that authorities have started deporting eight Tajik nationals who came to the U.S. at the southern border and were released but later found to allegedly have ties to ISIS.Fox News' Louis Casiano and David Spunt, and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",09-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/afghan-national-charged-election-day-terror-plot-reignites-vetting-concerns-glaring-alarms,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
140,"Colorado Supreme Court dismisses lawsuit against Christian baker who refused to bake trans cake","The Colorado Supreme Court dismissed yet another case Tuesday against Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips, a Christian baker who has been the target of several lawsuits over the last 12 years. The latest lawsuit accused Phillips of discriminating against a transgender attorney for refusing to bake a custom cake celebrating their gender transition.Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the lawyer group representing Phillips, first defended Phillips in 2012 when he was sued for refusing to bake a custom cake celebrating a same-sex wedding because it violated his religious convictions."Enough is enough. Jack has been dragged through courts for over a decade. It’s time to leave him alone," Jake Warner, ADF senior counsel, said in a statement.BIDEN OFFICIALS PUSHED TO DROP AGE LIMIT ON TRANS SURGERIES FOR MINORS: REPORT"Free speech is for everyone. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in 303 Creative, the government cannot force artists to express messages they don’t believe. In this case, an attorney demanded that Jack create a custom cake that would celebrate and symbolize a transition from male to female. Because that cake admittedly expresses a message, and because Jack cannot express that message for anyone, the government cannot punish Jack for declining to express it. The First Amendment protects that decision."While the state court did not issue an opinion regarding Phillips' First Amendment rights, it was dismissed on the grounds of violating a technicality, stating that plaintiff Autumn Scardina, a man identifying as a woman, did not properly file the lawsuit in Colorado."We granted review to determine, among other issues, whether [the attorney] properly filed [this] case," the Colorado Supreme Court wrote in its opinion in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Scardina. "We conclude that [the attorney] did not."OVER 5,700 CHILDREN IN 5-YEAR PERIOD HAD GENDER SURGERIES, MOST FROM 5 LIBERAL STATES: WATCHDOG"The underlying constitutional question this case raises has become the focus of intense public debate: How should governments balance the rights of transgender individuals to be free from discrimination in places of public accommodation with the rights of religious business owners when they are operating in the public market?" Justice Melissa Hart wrote in the Colorado Supreme Court’s majority opinion. "We cannot answer that question."On the same day the U.S. Supreme Court revealed it would hear Phillips' initial case — which he won in 2018 after Colorado tried to force him to make a custom cake for a same-sex wedding — the transgender attorney contacted Phillips' shop for a custom order to celebrate a gender transition. Phillips' declined.COLORADO STATE WINS IN STRAIGHT SETS AFTER DECIDING TO PLAY AGAINST TEAM MIRED IN TRANS PLAYER CONTROVERSYThe attorney called again later to request a second cake, this one featuring Satan smoking marijuana, to "correct the errors of [Phillips’] thinking," according to the ADF news release."Phillips politely declined both requests because the cakes express messages that violate his core beliefs," ADF stated. "The attorney then filed the most recent lawsuit, threatening to continue harassing Phillips until he is punished. Phillips serves people from all backgrounds. Like many artists, he decides to create custom cakes based on what they will express, not who requests them."",09-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/colorado-supreme-court-dismisses-lawsuit-against-christian-baker-who-refused-bake-trans-cake,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,Others
141,"Ohio Lt. Gov. encourages support for Trump’s ‘swamp the vote’ strategy as key state's early voting opens","COLUMBUS, Ohio – Early voting in the former battleground state of Ohio began on Tuesday and Fox News Digital spoke to the state’s GOP lieutenant governor, who explained why Republicans are encouraging voters to vote early."I want to do what President Trump's asking us to do, to swamp your vote, because we want everybody across the country and in the state of Ohio to get out there and vote early so that their voices, their votes are locked in, then the campaign can then move on to make sure that they're focusing resources on people who may not have gotten out and voted," Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted told Fox News Digital at the Franklin County Board of Elections on Tuesday as he voted on the first day of early voting. "It's a really important part of the campaign strategy."The former president's 2024 campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced earlier this year the launch of what they call their "Swamp the Vote USA" effort, which was a shift from 2020, when Trump spoke in opposition to early-in-person voting and mail-in ballots. OHIO GOP SENATE CANDIDATE MORENO HITS BROWN ON INFLATION REDUCTION ACT VOTE IN AD THAT'S PART OF $25M BUY"Whether you vote absentee, by mail, early in person, or on Election Day—We will Secure Your Vote," Trump posted online at the time. "JUST VOTE! They are all good options. The way to win is to Swamp Them with Votes!"Republican voters are typically known for voting on Election Day, while Democrats often have the advantage when it comes to early voting efforts. Husted told Fox News Digital that people should vote in whatever way they are most comfortable, but encouraged early voting. "If you want to vote on Election Day, that's fine," Husted said. "But we're encouraging those who are willing to vote early because once the campaigns know you voted, they can devote their resources to turning out people who haven't voted. The system of elections here in Ohio is a place where we make it easy to vote and hard to cheat and when you get that done early, you can know that the system is working for you and that you can encourage your friends and neighbors to go out and get it done."Husted continued, "I think it's really important that Republicans don't let Democrats get the lead through early voting. Think about this. If you vote early, then if something comes up on Election Day, there's a hurricane that hits you, a storm that happens, something might get in the way of you getting to the polls. When you do it early, you ensure that your vote happens, that it's going to be there, it's going to get counted, and something doesn't get in the way between now and Election Day."NRA TARGETS SEN SHERROD BROWN IN 7-FIGURE AD BUY IN OHIO: 'VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT'Although Ohio is no longer viewed as the battleground state it was for many years for presidential elections, the Buckeye State is home to several critical House races and a Senate race that could potentially shift the balance of power in Congress.Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno, running as a Republican in that Senate race against incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown, rallied supporters outside the Franklin County Board of Elections on Tuesday and also pushed Trump’s "Swamp the Vote" plan.A spokesperson for the Franklin County Board of Elections told Fox News Digital that over 4,000 Ohioans voted early at the Columbus voting site on Tuesday."The election is down to the hands of the voters and regardless if you want to support me or my opponent, President Trump or Kamala Harris, it's your civic duty to show up and vote," Moreno said. "Our elections in Ohio are secure. They're safe. On Nov. 5, we'll have an outcome and everybody will agree on that outcome. I encourage everybody to vote early. Bank that vote. Get your vote in there."Moreno continued, "It's a beautiful day today, but we have no idea what Nov. 5 will look like. If you're not voting, you're part of the problem. We’ve got to make sure that you have your voice heard. Look, the earlier you can vote, it's better for us as Republicans because we get to take you off the list. We don’t have to text you, email you, knock on your door – if that alone doesn't motivate you. But look, at the end of the day, here's a very simple equation where we're at right now. You vote for me, for Bernie Moreno, for the United States Senate, and your vote for me is a vote to fire Sherrod Brown. The first thing I'm going to do as senator, what we get to do when we get down there, we fire Chuck Schumer."Fox News Digital’s Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report",09-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-lt-gov-encourages-support-trumps-swamp-the-vote-strategy-key-state-early-voting-opens,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Positive / Uplifting"
142,"Michigan Senate candidates clash on national security, immigration and abortion","Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican former Congressman Mike Rogers clashed over national security, immigration and abortion at a debate Tuesday as each candidate vies to be the next U.S. senator from Michigan. Retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., has endorsed Slotkin, a three-term lawmaker who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District, to fill her seat. Rogers served in the House from 2001-2015, was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and has been endorsed by former President Trump. This race in battleground Michigan is close, though Slotkin has enjoyed an average 5 percentage point lead in public opinion polls. The victor could very well determine which major party gains control of the Senate next year. Fox News' Power Rankings list the Michigan Senate race as Lean D.The hour-long debate hosted by NBC affiliate WOOD TV was mostly polite and issues-focused. However, there were several times when the candidates accused each other of lying or twisting the facts of their records. FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE"Dishonest and deceptive," Rogers fumed after Slotkin insisted he repeatedly voted to "privatize or cut Medicare and Social Security" while he was a member of Congress. "I'm not even sure she could pass the polygraph test in the CIA anymore," he said, referring to Slotkin's former career as a CIA analyst.Slotkin hit back later after Rogers said she was "huffing at the microphone" during a discussion about nuclear power and competition with China. "It's just sad that a guy who considers himself a national security guy can't see that we need to work together on this issue, not lie repeatedly," she said. Early voting is underway in swing state Michigan and both candidates pitched themselves as willing to work with the other side. Each attacked the other as a partisan. "We're a very purple state. Lots of Democrats, lots of Republicans," Slotkin acknowledged. "I was voted the 14th most bipartisan member of Congress out of 435." She noted that Rogers served as deputy whip in the House, "the guy who got everyone to vote with the Republicans." MICHIGAN DEM LAUNCHES ANTI-EV AD IN BID FOR SENATE RACE AFTER VOTING AGAINST A BIPARTISAN PUSHBACK ON MANDATESRogers in turn said Slotkin contributed to high gas prices, inflated grocery bills and increasing crime by "voting 100% with the Biden-Harris agenda." He said that if elected to the Senate, he "will look for every opportunity to be bipartisan." The candidates appeared deeply divided on issues of foreign policy, national security, immigration and abortion. Slotkin framed electric vehicle production in Michigan as a national security issue. "I don't care what kind of car you want to drive," she said, before adding that it will either be "us or China" that builds the next generation of vehicles. "China is eating our lunch on these types of vehicles," Slotkin continued, warning that Michigan's auto industry may repeat a historic mistake by "ceding ground" to a foreign competitor if America does not invest in EVs. Rogers accused Slotkin of supporting EV mandates and pointed out, "85% of everything processed in electric vehicles has to go through China." "Why in God's green earth we would cede that auto market to the Communist Party of China is beyond me," he said. "My opponent has multiple times supported EV mandates, trying to pick the cars that our companies have to build and the cars that you're going to have to buy. And by the way, that got us 2,400 layoffs at Stellantis, a thousand layoffs at General Motors. Ford is talking about closing two lines. The CEO of Ford came out and said this is unworkable. It won't work for America."The debate became heated as each candidate tried to accuse the other of having a close relationship with China. Rogers repeated allegations he's made on the campaign trail that Slotkin signed a non-disclosure agreement with Gotion, a Chinese-linked company that has received $175 million in taxpayer money to build a battery plant in Big Rapids. Slotkin said her opponent's claims were "offensive" and shot back that Rogers was chief security officer of AT&T "when they were actively working to get Chinese companies into our telecoms." Rogers denied the charge. In another exchange on the Middle East, Rogers jabbed at "my opponent’s notion that their somehow serving in Iraq gives permission to be wrong in the entire effort toward Iran." Slotkin accompanied troops as a CIA analyst during three tours in Iraq. THE BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXONWhen the topic turned to abortion, Rogers said the choice to terminate a pregnancy is "the most heart-wrenching decision a woman will ever have to make." Acknowledging that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, permitting states to regulate abortion, Rogers said, "The people of Michigan voted overwhelmingly to make abortion legal in a part of the state constitution of Michigan. I will do nothing when I go back to Washington, D.C., to do anything that would change what the Michigan Constitution, voted on by the people of Michigan, have given us that guidance to go back."Slotkin said she would vote for a bill to codify Roe – thereby erasing state restrictions on abortion – and said Rogers could not be trusted on the issue. "He voted for every single ban, every restriction, every bill that came across his desk to make it harder for a woman and to ban, in some cases, a woman and her right to choose 56 times in total." "He voted and sponsored bills that would make it impossible to have IVF and contraception," she asserted. "If he does not trust us to protect our own rights, do not trust him." "Deceive and deception," retorted Rogers. "I have come out and talked about making sure that IVF is available for families so they can grow their families. It's a very personal thing for these families, and I support it 100%."Slotkin also framed Rogers as a carpetbagger, noting that he was living in Cape Coral, Florida, while Michigan voters took up the abortion question in a ballot initiative in 2022, before Rogers returned to Michigan to run for Senate. On immigration, Slotkin said the "system is broken" and that Congress must do more to secure the border. "To me, if you are not here legally, you should not be here. You should go back to your home country and be removed to your home country." She accused Republicans of using the issue as a "political talking point," noting that a bipartisan border security deal in the Senate fell apart after GOP opposition. Rogers said he was "delighted to hear that my opponent has had a conversion about border security" after supporting the Biden administration's policies. "Here's the thing. You can't vote against the wall. You can't vote against sanctuary cities," he continued. "You cannot do the things that you've been doing in allowing 10 million people to come into our country. We spent something like $450 billion on taking care of illegals' room and board and phones and health care. That's enough money to pay for every Michigan teacher and every Michigan state trooper for 15 years."He called the bipartisan bill Slotkin referenced "a bill to exacerbate and make permanent the problem." Tuesday's debate was the first of two planned debates between the Senate hopefuls.

143,"FEMA reports it has under 10% of front-line staff available ahead of Hurricane Milton","The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has less than 10% of front-line staff available for deployment amid preparations for the second major hurricane to hit the Southeast this month, according to the agency's daily operations briefing.FEMA released a daily briefing on Wednesday revealing the agency had only 8%, or 1,115, FEMA staff members currently available as preparations continue for Hurricane Milton, which is expected to hit Florida in the coming days. This number represents a significant drop in availability from a year prior, after an operations briefing from late September 2023 showed the agency had 20% of the same staff available for deployment. A FEMA spokesperson indicated to Fox News Digital that the availability numbers released by the agency are only in reference to the cadre of staffers who are part of FEMA's incident management core capacity. They are the first line of FEMA staffers to deploy in any disaster. Meanwhile, the FEMA spokesperson pointed out the agency has a total workforce of 22,000 staffers it can tap, as well as resources from other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security.  The fear of front-line FEMA staffing comes amid other concerns about FEMA's response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, including claims that the agency spent its money on housing for migrants and is blocking private relief distributors from entering areas in North Carolina impacted by Helene.FEMA HEAD DENIES AGENCY IS SHORT ON MONEY FOR DISASTER RELIEF BECAUSE FUNDS WENT TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  In May 2023, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report indicating that, as of the start of Fiscal Year 2022, FEMA was understaffed by 35% with an overall staffing gap of approximately 6,200 employees. FEMA officials attributed the shortage to "responsibilities due to COVID-19 and managing the rising disaster activity during the year, which increased burnout and employee attrition," according to the GAO.With Hurricane Helene making a destructive and deadly sweep across the South, FEMA has been under high pressure to deliver aid to those in need. In the latest update on FEMA worker numbers, the agency indicated more than 5,600 personnel from across the federal workforce have been deployed, including more than 1,500 from FEMA. Additionally, the agency noted it has shipped more than 11.5 million meals, more than 12.6 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 400,000 tarps to the region, while also helping thousands of Helene survivors with more than $45 million in "flexible, upfront" funding.Despite the current staffing shortage, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorks insisted during an interview with MSNBC that Americans "should rest confident that FEMA has the resources" necessary to recover from Helene and prepare for Milton."We have search and rescue teams. The Army Corps of Engineers are there. We are ready," Mayorkas said of Florida, in reference to the federal government's preparation for Milton. "FEMA likes to say it is, 'FEMA-flexible.' We can respond to multiple events at a single time."VIDEO RESURFACES SHOWING FEMA PRIORITIZING EQUITY OVER HELPING GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN DISASTER RELIEFHowever, despite the optimistic response to concerns about FEMA resources, Mayorkas did say last week during a formal press conference that "FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the [hurricane] season."Questions about FEMA funding have been exacerbated by suggestions that the agency was giving disaster relief money to migrants. FEMA has sent aid to migrants, but the money was part of the Shelter and Services Program, which remains separate from disaster relief funds. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R–La., acknowledged that the funds were part of a separate program unrelated to disaster relief, but noted that he didn't think the agency should be involved in the migrant crisis.SPEAKER JOHNSON ADDRESSES CLAIMS FEMA DIVERTED FUNDS TO IMMIGRATION EFFORTS: ‘AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED’"The streams of funding are different, that is not an untrue statement, of course," Johnson told Fox News’ Shannon Bream. "But the problem is with the American people, see, and what they're frustrated by, is that FEMA should be involved."Concerns that private relief distributors are being blocked from entering parts of North Carolina that were impacted have also circulated. "Some of the reports that I've received through some of my contacts who are trying to provide assistance... they're being told that they need special requirements from FEMA in order to enter these certain areas," said Joe Rieck, vice president of My Patriot Supply, an emergency preparedness company. Before Helene made landfall, Congress passed a stopgap spending bill that included money for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, but excluded billions in additionally requested supplemental disaster funding. On Friday, President Biden wrote a letter to Congress urging them to provide additional funding because "while FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year," he said. "Without additional funding, FEMA would be required to forego longer-term recovery activities in favor of meeting urgent needs," Biden added. "The Congress should provide FEMA additional resources to avoid forcing that kind of unnecessary trade-off and to give the communities we serve the certainty of knowing that help will be ongoing, both for the short- and long-term."When pressed about reconvening the House for a special session to approve additional funding, Johnson suggested FEMA has the funds it needs right now and, in order to approve additional funding, Congress needs requests from individual states to tabulate how much to provide. "The way the process works is the states, local authorities, they band together, they assess the damages, they send that to the federal authorities and it's all worked through in that manner," Johnson responded when pressed about whether he had plans to reconvene Congress for the matter. "It will take some time to tabulate this storm — it's one of the biggest in our history — so a lot of that work is being done immediately. I think the timing of that will probably correspond when Congress is expected to return to session right after the election."",09-10-2024,10-10-2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fema-has-under-ten-percent-staff-available-ahead-hurricane-milton,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/politics,"Natural Disasters"
144,"Xi Jinping celebrates China’s rising power — and his own","HARI SREENIVASAN: President Xi Jinping opened China’s twice-per-decade Communist Party Congress today with a lengthy list of his achievements during his first five-year term, and his vision of where he hopes to take his nation.But beyond the words, Xi is asserting power like no Chinese leader in decades.William Brangham reports.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The applause, the music, it was a reception befitting the commanding role that Xi Jinping has taken since being named party leader five years ago.He opened today’s proceedings by hailing reforms he’s put in place, and proclaiming a — quote — “new era for China.”PRESIDENT XI JINPING, China (through interpreter): The Chinese nation has realized a great leap, from declining in modern history to twisting its fate fundamentally and continuously moving to prosperity.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Over 3.5 hours, Xi laid out his vision to shape the nation of 1.4 billion people into what he called a — quote — “great modern socialist country” over the next three decades.PRESIDENT XI JINPING (through interpreter): Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no walk in the park, and it will take more than drumbeating and gong-clanging to get there. The whole party must be prepared to make more arduous, strenuous efforts.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Susan Shirk is chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.SUSAN SHIRK, University of California, San Diego: Xi Jinping has a vision of China’s role in the world that is much more ambitious than anything we have seen before, talking about China kind of moving toward the center of the world and having a lot more influence than it did before.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In his address, Xi largely ignored the question of political reforms in China, and he didn’t mention President Trump or North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.But in a rare move, he did acknowledge that with global demand weakening, there were challenges facing China’s export-driven economy.PRESIDENT XI JINPING (through interpreter):  While China’s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world, the more prominent problem is that our development is unbalanced and inadequate.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Xi was one of the first foreign leaders to meet with President Trump.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The relationship developed by President Xi and myself, I think, is outstanding.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That was decidedly warmer than Mr. Trump’s past criticism of China and its economic and trade policies.But other U.S. officials are more critical of Beijing’s actions.REX TILLERSON, Secretary of State: China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson today criticized China’s aggressive displays of economic and military power, particularly its expansion on man-made islands in the South China Sea.REX TILLERSON: We will not shrink from China’s challenges to the rules-based order, and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.SUSAN SHIRK: I think there are things to worry about in Chinese foreign policy that are mostly related to these maritime sovereignty issues and to a kind of bullying in Asia, but the global ambition could turn out to be positive.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Susan Shirk says China has filled a vacuum left by the United States’ withdrawal from global agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accords.Perhaps the most important thing to watch for in the next few days is who Xi establishes as his likely successor.SUSAN SHIRK: That is why there is a lot of speculation now that he may be trying, much like Putin, to stay on beyond his normal term or to rule behind the scenes even after he retires.WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President Trump will be traveling to Beijing to meet Xi next month.For the PBS NewsHour, I’m William Brangham.The post Xi Jinping celebrates China’s rising power — and his own appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",18-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/xi-jinping-celebrates-chinas-rising-power/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,Others
145,"The battle for Mosul is over, but this hidden ISIS danger could lurk for years","HARI SREENIVASAN: But first: The de facto capital of the Islamic State, Raqqa, in Syria fell yesterday to U.S.-backed forces.However, the largest city the militants once held was Mosul in Iraq. They were ousted from it in July after a brutal 10-month-long fight that killed thousands.Now a new major task: finding and destroying the ISIS mines, booby-traps and bombs that litter the city.Special correspondent Marcia Biggs reports from Iraq.MARCIA BIGGS, Special Correspondent: It was once a center of learning for over 6,000 students of technology, agriculture, and medicine.Today, Mosul Technical Institute’s classrooms are burnt to the ground, laboratories reduced to rubble, and books charred and shredded. It’s one of the city’s five universities ravaged by the Islamic State and the battle to oust it.Now that the battle is over, a new danger looms, the trail of land mines and booby-traps left by ISIS.So this is the wire, and this is where it was buried.CHRISTIAN, Team Leader, Janus Global Operations: Yes, they would cut the asphalt, and then they lay the wire in and put the main charge here.MARCIA BIGGS: We spent the day with Christian, a team leader from Janus Global, a security and risk management firm hired by the U.S. government to sweep and clear major areas of unexploded ordnance and mines.He’s not allowed to show his face or use his last name, for security reasons.CHRISTIAN: There’s actually two more on that road before we get to the target building that have to be excavated and/or rendered safe.MARCIA BIGGS: So, the first building you have to clear, you have got to get rid of the IEDs on the road to that building?CHRISTIAN: Yes.MARCIA BIGGS: It’s a long process.CHRISTIAN: It is, but that’s what makes it interesting.MARCIA BIGGS: The United States has sunk $30 million this year into clearing former ISIS territories all over Northern Iraq. Under this program, Janus has already cleared 727 buildings, removing 3,000 IEDs, which they say ISIS was producing on assembly lines at an industrial scale.But State Department officials and experts say the number of unexploded ordnance in Mosul itself is unprecedented.What’s your first line of attack, in terms of trying to clear Mosul?CHRISTIAN: Our priority is more the community, rather than the individual, you know, infrastructure. You have got schools, power, sewer, water, so that the area can accept people back into it. And then, once this stabilization phase is over, we can move into the individual homes, so that they can be safer.MARCIA BIGGS: Clearing Mosul is a process that they say could take years, even decades. So Janus is training local Iraqis to do the job, sending them out as a front-line search team, then investigating and removing any suspicious items themselves.CHRISTIAN: We’re not going to be here the whole time, so when we — it’s our time to leave, they will have the capacity built from us, and the mentoring we have done, so that they can do it on their own.MARCIA BIGGS: How are they doing?CHRISTIAN: They’re — a lot of them are very apt to learn. They’re quick. They’re smart.MARCIA BIGGS: Fawzi al Nabdi is the team leader for the Iraqi local partner. He’s cleared mines all over Iraq for the last six years.CHRISTIAN: What you got?FAWZI AL NABDI, Team Leader, Al Fahad Company (through interpreter): We are ready for this, because it’s my job and I love it. The Americans are here to complete our work and to help us. They have greater experience than we do. If we find any mines, we have to stop and they will investigate it and make a plan to remove it.MARCIA BIGGS: But he says Mosul is the biggest project he has ever seen, and we’re told it could take at least a month to just get the campus cleared of mines. Only then can they start cleaning it up, so that students can resume classes, this itself a huge task.ISIS fighters closed the university back in 2014, and used it as a military base. As coalition forces pounded ISIS targets, this seat of higher learning became a battleground.Ghassan Alubaidy is the institute’s dean.GHASSAN ALUBAIDY, Dean, Mosul Technical Institute (through interpreter): ISIS used our university to manufacture mines and bombs. For this reason, it was the target of airstrikes in the beginning. They struck the institute nine times, and they struck our workshops, too. Now we can’t use them.MARCIA BIGGS: The former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, recently listed 81 locations where bombs were dropped, but had not yet exploded.Facilities used to make weapons were often on the list of high-value targets for the coalition. So now those places are twice as likely to contain dangerous items.So, this was once a workshop for electrical engineering students. You can still see the lab tables here. It was hit by an airstrike in 2015. Afterwards, members of the university staff found bomb-making instructions among the rubble. This was likely an ISIS bomb-making factory, and judging by the crater, a high-value target.Despite the damage, Dean Alubaidy says he will hold classes this fall in alternate buildings, until the campus is ready. He’s expecting registration to be in the thousands, students who lost three years of education during the fighting and don’t want to lose another one.GHASSAN ALUBAIDY (through interpreter): On our Facebook pages, we found a great number of students posting that they were full of encouragement to come back. For us, it was unbelievable. We couldn’t imagine it, to see how many students wanted to start again, how they were dreaming of the first day of classes, when they could sit in front of teachers again and start to live their lives again.MARCIA BIGGS: Next door, Mosul University has already started classes. Students even volunteered to help in the cleanup.But across the river, West Mosul was the site of ISIS’ last stand and bore the brunt of the battle. It’s densely packed Old City, with its flattened buildings, is a challenge for mine-sweeping.FAWZI AL-NABDI (through interpreter): Most of the homes here were full of mines. And just here in front of us, a man with two kids came back to his home, and when he opened the door, the bomb killed him and his kids.MARCIA BIGGS: Ahmed Younes fled back in early July with only the clothes on his back. Residents have been virtually banned from returning to his neighborhood on the outskirts of the Old City, but Ahmed said he got special permission, in order to retrieve some personal items.AHMED YOUNES, Local Resident (through interpreter): We came on our own. We got permission to come, but they are not responsible if anything happens to us.MARCIA BIGGS: Right now, there is no plan to begin clearing the Old City or even to determine how many mines there are. It is still out of bounds to anyone but the Iraqi security forces.So the Janus team is focusing on progress in the rest of the city, building by building, bomb by bomb.CHRISTIAN: Whoever made this device had a set goal. And to allow him to win, people get hurt. So you kind of compete against him to be better than him to take it out before it can do any harm.MARCIA BIGGS: So, you feel like you’re winning the battle against ISIS?CHRISTIAN: Yes, one IED at a time.MARCIA BIGGS: For the PBS NewsHour, I’m Marcia Biggs in Mosul, Iraq.HARI SREENIVASAN: Tune in later.Frontline’s latest film, “Mosul,” was on the ground filming the fight as it unfolded street by street and house by house.

146,"As Rohingya refugees continue to flee from persecution, here’s how you can help","More than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled their homes since August to escape systematic violence at the hands of government soldiers in Myanmar. The U.N. has called the actions taken by Myanmar forces against the group “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”A report released by Amnesty International on Wednesday documents widespread rape, killings and burnings of Rohingya across the Rakhine State in Myanmar. The report includes extensive interviews of Rohingya refugees who tell stories of live burnings, sexual violence and mass shootings at the hands of soldiers. To escape persecution, Rohingya refugees are fleeing in droves to neighboring Bangladesh, a country described by some as a reluctant host for the thousands of refugees behind its borders. Conditions within Bangladesh show refugee camps beyond capacity, as organizations struggle to keep up with humanitarian aid. Find out more: Rohingya Muslims have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982, though they’ve lived in the area since the 12th century.  They are not considered one of the country’s official ethnic groups. As such, their lack of official identity bars them from government services and travel.Officials from Myanmar, a majority Buddhist state, claim Rohingya are actually immigrants from Bangladesh to justify their exclusion of the group. This most recent burst of violence comes from Myanmar’s crackdown following clashes with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). After the government declared ARSA a terrorist organization, the retaliation escalated into hundreds of Rohingya villages. Where to give: BRAC, a top-ranked NGO based out of Bangladesh, is scaling up humanitarian efforts for clean water, health, sanitation and child care for refugees from Myanmar.

147,"Tillerson: ‘Heartbreaking’ reports of suffering in Myanmar","Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Wednesday.WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is condemning reported atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, and he says those responsible — perhaps the country’s military — will be held accountable.Tillerson says accounts of the suffering of the Rohingya are “heartbreaking” — and that if those reports are true, then “someone is going to be held to account for that.”Tillerson — who’s set to visit South Asia next week — is urging the Myanmar government to improve humanitarian access to the population in western Rakhine state.Amnesty International has accused Myanmar’s security forces of killing hundreds of men, women and children during a systematic campaign to expel the Rohingya. More than 580,000 refugees have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August.“We really hold the military leadership accountable for what’s happening,” Tillerson said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “What’s most important to us is that the world can’t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in that area.”He also called Wednesday for the U.S. and India to expand strategic ties. He pointedly criticized China, which he accused of challenging international norms needed for global stability.He said the world needed the U.S. and India to have a strong partnership. The two nations share goals of security, free navigation, free trade and fighting terrorism in the Indo-Pacific, and serve as “the eastern and western beacons” for an international rules-based order which is increasingly under strain, he said.Both India and China had benefited from that order, but Tillerson said India had done so while respecting rules and norms, while China had “at times” undermined them. To make his point, he alluded to China’s island building and expansive territorial claims in seas where Beijing has long-running disputes with Southeast Asian neighbors.“China’s provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for,” Tillerson said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.He added that the U.S. seeks constructive relations with China but “won’t shrink” from the challenges it poses when it “subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries, and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.”U.S.-India relations have generally prospered in the past decade, in part because of their shared concerns about the rise of China. While President Donald Trump has looked to deepen cooperation with China on addressing the nuclear threat from North Korea, he’s also sought a closer relationship with India, which shares U.S. worries on Islamic extremism.“In this period of uncertainty and angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. I want to make clear: with our shared values and vision for global stability, peace and prosperity, the United States is that partner,” Tillerson said.Tillerson said the U.S. wants to help improve India’s military capabilities, and also improve security cooperation among the region’s major democracies, which included Japan and Australia.Tillerson said the U.S. and India were leading regional efforts on counterterrorism. He called for India’s archrival Pakistan “to take decisive action against terrorist groups based within their own borders that threaten its own people and the broader region.”The post Tillerson: ‘Heartbreaking’ reports of suffering in Myanmar appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",18-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/tillerson-heartbreaking-reports-suffering-myanmar/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
148,"Far-right groups gain ground in Sweden and Germany amid migrant influx","JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: Sunday’s elections Austria were the latest ample of a shift to the right Europe’s politics, as 31-year-old Christian Kurz was elected chancellor on an anti-immigration platform.He may now form a government with a far-right party founded in the 1950s by former Nazis.That follows recent elections in Germany, where a far-right party roiled the race and dealt a blow to returning leader Angela Merkel.In Sweden, too, there is a strong challenge from the right and a neo-Nazi group that looks stand in elections next year.Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant ha been surveying the political landscape in Germany and Sweden, and he begins his report in Scandinavia.MALCOLM BRABANT, Special Correspondent: In a Gothenburg parking lot, supporters of the Nordic Resistance Movement form up for what they hope will be their biggest-ever march, to propagate an ideology espoused by mother of eight Paulina Forslund.PAULINA FORSLUND, Nordic Resistance Movement: When white becomes the minority, they will be destroyed. I want my children to have a secure future. I want them not only for them to have a secure Sweden. I want them to have a secure world. And I want other people to fight for the same thing.MALCOLM BRABANT: When addressing her fellow neo-Nazis, Forslund’s rhetoric sharpens.PAULINA FORSLUND (through interpreter): I’m the welder’s daughter, the forester’s grandchild. My line consists of hardworking men and women. It’s people like them we can thank for the welfare system that our lying politicians are now giving away to imported scum.MALCOLM BRABANT: Clearly expecting trouble, the movement’s leaders have a muscular protection detail, marching past a silent protest. The sign reads “No Nazis on our streets.”This protester would only give her name as Johanna.JOHANNA, Anti-Nazi Protester: They are racist people. They are people who think that certain people are better than others, and I will not stand for that. It’s not something I think has a place in a modern society.MALCOLM BRABANT: Experts say the resistance movement is recruiting aggressively, and believe this demonstration is emblematic of the rise of the far right.It took place on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.Allan Stutzinky is leader of Gothenburg’s Jewish community.ALLAN STUTZINKY, Jewish Community Leader (through interpreter): Nazism has returned. The descendants of the murderers are organizing the same marches today, waving the same flags, shouting the same slogans, and have the same racist agenda.MALCOLM BRABANT: Anna Johansson is a member of the governing Social Democrat Party. It’s considering outlawing the Nordic Resistance Movement.ANNA JOHANSSON, Swedish Social Democratic Party: In Sweden and in Denmark, and in other countries, extreme parties are growing, and the hatred is spreading around.MALCOLM BRABANT: “Go home to mama,” he shouts. “Nazi pigs,” chant the anti- fascist protesters, as a bottle flies through the air.DAMON, Nordic Resistance Movement: If someone calls themselves a Nazi, most of us would dissociate with that person. That’s nothing we stand for ourselves. I never call myself a Nazi. I’m a national socialist.MALCOLM BRABANT: Hitler’s party was also called National Socialist, but Damon, a 40-year-old welder, insists he’s a nonviolent family man.DAMON: The demographic landscape of our — of the whole of Europe is changing, so, basically, it’s a concern on preserving my heritage for my family and our kin.MALCOLM BRABANT: This demonstration has been stopped short of its destination. The Nordic Resistance Movement is currently trapped between a line of police and anti-fascist protesters. And it looks as though this demonstration isn’t going any further.Violence briefly erupts as the resistance movement tries to break through police lines, and several marchers are arrested.PAULINA FORSLUND: We are not your enemy. We are the government’s enemy.They say we live in a democracy, but we have never had an election about if we want to take all these people in.MALCOLM BRABANT: When Europe’s refugee crisis began in 2015, Sweden copied Germany’s open-door policy, and 160,000 migrants entered the country. Two years on, Sweden has tighter borders and has begun deporting some of the newcomers.The new atmosphere alarms Floid Gumbo, entertaining an anti-Nazi rally.FLOID GUMBO, Singer Originally from Zimbabwe: I came to Sweden over 20 years ago. The climate in Sweden, the people were so friendly, and things were completely different, more welcoming. And I feel like things have sort of gradually changed.I’m very concerned, because I have children, because I’m thinking what I experienced here is not the same kind of climate, atmosphere that they are going to experience here.ANNA JOHANSSON: It’s not so long ago that the Nazis ruined Europe. And that makes me very worried. The German elections were terrifying, I think.MALCOLM BRABANT: Johansson is referring to last month’s success of the right-wing Alternative For Germany Party, or AFD, when it entered Parliament for the first time with 13 percent of the vote.HUGH BRONSON, Alternative For Germany Party: The AFD only came into existence because Merkel deserted the traditional conservative Christian voters. They were looking for a home, and the AFD has offered them a safe place.MALCOLM BRABANT: Hugh Bronson is deputy leader of the AFD in Berlin.Now his party, the third largest in Parliament, is demanding that Angela Merkel imposes tougher immigration rules.Your opponents claim that you are a party of hate. What’s your response to that?HUGH BRONSON: We embrace foreigners who respect our laws, pay their taxes, send their children to school, and go about their normal life. The problem is with people who abuse the system to have a better life, or let others pay for their better lives, or who are criminals.MALCOLM BRABANT: Outside the opera house in Dresden, former East Germany, singer Luca Bergelt is dismayed by the political landscape shifting to the right.LUCA BERGELT, Singer: My fear is that they will tear Europe apart. They are going to raise up the walls again. They’re going to build new walls between the countries, and that Europe will get more close into itself.MALCOLM BRABANT: Anti-immigrant sentiment is strong in Dresden. The city was the birthplace of a pan-European anti-Islamic movement, and it delivered the largest number of votes for the right-wing party.On a holiday to celebrate German unification after the fall of communism, retired engineer Wilfried Schmidt explained why he sent a message to Angela Merkel.WILFRIED SCHMIDT, Retired Engineer (through interpretor): Let’s put it this way. We all need to recognize that Germany is undergoing social changes that are becoming harder to control. For one, there is mass immigration from difficult regions that is increasingly uncontrollable, of people with entirely different concepts of life, from fundamental differently structured societies that are problematic.MALCOLM BRABANT: About one million migrants poured into Germany in 2015. Chancellor Merkel consistently defended her pro-refugee policies, but now she has been punished by voters who believe she ignored their concerns.Chancellor Merkel has promised to listen to the people who voted for the AFD, and she says she’s going to try to win them over with what she calls good politics. But she will not countenance having the party in her coalition.But the chancellor needs to find new partners who are prepared to be tough on immigration.As she tries to forge a coalition, the chancellor has agreed to put an annual cap of 200,000 on the number of immigrants, something she previously refused to do. But will it be enough to woo back people who deserted her at the election?A question for Werner Patzelt, a political scientist at Dresden University.WERNER PATZELT, Dresden University: Since Chancellor Merkel has made so many U-turns in German domestic politics, it wouldn’t be a surprise if she would try to do a U-turn, also winning back AFD voters.But this is a really hard political task, because so many of them are so much disappointed by the Christian Democratic Union in general, and by Chancellor Merkel in particular, that they will do anything to avoid going back.MALCOLM BRABANT: Back in Sweden, the governing party is horrified at the concept of conceding ground to right-wingers, and is trying to isolate them.ANNA JOHANSSON: Experience shows that, when you adopt the ideas from these right-wing parties, they spread. These parties have their agenda implemented by other parties. And I wouldn’t want to see that happen in Sweden.FLOID GUMBO: We’re all human beings. We share this world. We’re all here. There’s enough space for us all.MALCOLM BRABANT: But that’s an appeal that an increasing number of Swedes are rejecting, as the country and much of Europe go through a crisis of identity.For the PBS NewsHour, I’m Malcolm Brabant in Gothenburg.The post Far-right groups gain ground in Sweden and Germany amid migrant influx appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",17-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/far-right-groups-gain-ground-sweden-germany-amid-migrant-influx/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
149,"U.S.-backed Syrian forces recapture Raqqa from Islamic State group","U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had captured the city of Raqqa from Islamic State militants.“Everything is finished in Raqqa, our forces have taken full control of Raqqa,” SDF spokesman Talal Sello told AFP. A formal declaration would be announced after operations to clear any remaining sleeper cells and to remove landmines in the city were completed, Sello added.The move is a major setback for the Islamic State which considered Raqqa the de-facto capital of its self-declared caliphate. It comes on the third anniversary of the global effort to defeat ISIS.Raqqa was the first provincial capital to fall from government control in March 2013 after it was captured by a rebel army. The army included both Syrian opposition groups and more hard line  parties including al-Nusra and the Islamic State.A civilian government  that was established in the city divided two months later, and less than a year later ISIS recaptured Raqqa and named the the capital of their caliphate.About 900 civilians have been killed since the the start of the five-month operation, including 570 people in coalition air raids, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the civilian death toll at 1,130 people. American journalist James Foley was beheaded in the mountains south of the city.SDF fighters pulled down the Islamic State’s black flag from the city’s National Hospital near the city’s stadium, according to a Reuters report.Special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Brett McGurk said in August that the U.S. would attempt to perform a “stabilization” in Raqqa — including demining, removing rubble from major pathways to allow trucks and equipment through, and “basic electricity, sewage, water, the basic essentials to allow populations to come back to their home.”It is not clear when the 300,000 civilians who have fled Raqqa since April during the operation will be able to return.The post U.S.-backed Syrian forces recapture Raqqa from Islamic State group appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",17-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-backed-syrian-forces-recapture-raqqa-from-islamic-state-group/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,Others

151,"U.S., Japan agree to maximize diplomatic pressure on North Korea","TOKYO — U.S. and Japanese diplomats agreed Tuesday to maximize pressure on North Korea to resolve tensions over its nuclear program, while citing the need to be prepared for the worst if diplomacy fails.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, after meeting his Japanese counterpart, Shinsuke Sugiyama, told reporters that the focus at the State Department is still on diplomacy to solve the problem and eventually denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.“We must, however, with our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere, be prepared for the worst should diplomacy fail,” he said. The U.S. must be prepared to defend itself and its allies, he said.Sugiyama, briefing reporters separately, reiterated Japan’s support for President Donald Trump’s policy of keeping all options open, but stressed the need for a diplomatic solution by bolstering cooperation among Japan, U.S. and South Korea, as well as via cooperation with China and Russia.The two diplomats will join their South Korean counterpart in Seoul for further talks Wednesday on North Korea.READ MORE: Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’The talks come as the U.S. and South Korea hold joint naval drills this week.

152,"News Wrap: Dozens missing after deadly Mogadishu truck bombing","JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day’s other news: More than 300 people are now confirmed dead after Saturday’s massive truck bombing in Somalia, one of the world’s worst attacks in years.Nearly 400 more were wounded. The government blamed the al-Qaida-linked Al-Shabaab group. Rescue crews today searched for survivors at the scene of the bombing, a crowded street in the capital, Mogadishu. With dozens still missing, officials say they expect the death toll to rise.OSMAN LIBAH IBRAHIM, Deputy Minister for Natural Resources, Somalia (through interpreter): More bodies are gradually being found and removed from the rubble. There are other people who are under the rubble. We have heard them as they scream for help. My biggest worry is that even the wounded are succumbing to their injuries.JUDY WOODRUFF: The attack happened two days after Somalia’s defense minister and army chief resigned for undisclosed reasons.There’s been yet another shift to the right in European politics; 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s foreign minister, is set to become that country’s next leader. But he’s short of a majority in Parliament and will likely form a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party. It was founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s.Kurz has called for the European Union to focus more on internal trade and securing borders.

The second didn’t detonate. Officials said Rahimi was inspired by ISIS and al-Qaida.JOHN MILLER, Deputy Commissioner, NYPD Intelligence & Counterterrorism: Ahmed Khan Rahimi learned a lesson which we keep reminding people of. This is the wrong place to try and carry out an act of terrorism.

153,"Why a power struggle has broken out over Kirkuk","JUDY WOODRUFF: Longstanding rivalries were re-ignited in Iraq today between vital American allies.Iraqi military forces and militia moved to push Kurdish forces out of the disputed city of Kirkuk in the country’s north.Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage.MAN (through interpreter): The commander in chief of the armed forces, Dr. Haider al-Abadi, gave orders to protect the people of Kirkuk and to impose security in the city.LISA DESJARDINS: After months of simmering tensions, Iraqi federal troops moved to retake the disputed city of Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.The effort launched before dawn. By midday, Iraqi soldiers, along with state-backed militias, quickly took control of several massive oil fields north of the city. Iraqis also captured Kirkuk’s military airport and various government buildings. They lowered what had been a symbolic Kurdish flag at the governor’s compound.Journalist Rebecca Collard in Irbil was in Kirkuk this morning.REBECCA COLLARD, Journalist: You could hear some clashes, some gunfire in the distance, but for the most part, the city seemed more or less abandoned. Now, the Iraqi army, by the end of today, was essentially in control of the whole city and many of the outskirts of Kirkuk.LISA DESJARDINS: The spokesman for an Iraqi Shiite militia said they achieved all their goals with little resistance.AHMED AL-ASSADI,  Spokesman for al-Hashed al-Shaabi (through translator): As the troops approached the area, they were confronted by some rebels, who tried to hinder the progress of the advancing units. Our troops returned fire and silenced its source.LISA DESJARDINS: This comes three weeks after the Kurds held a nonbinding independence referendum that included the disputed province of Kirkuk.More than 90 percent of the Kurdish region’s residents voted to split from Iraq. The Iraqi federal government, Turkey, Iran and the U.S. all rejected the independence drive.The multiethnic region of Kirkuk lies just outside of the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq’s north. Called the country’s oil capital, Kirkuk produces around 500,000 barrels a day.In 2014, amid the ISIS onslaught across Northern Iraq, the Kurds took control of Kirkuk, as the Iraqi military fled the city. In the three years since, the Kurds, led by their president, Massoud Barzani, sought to cement their hold, despite tensions with the central government.Today, Kurdish officials accused Iraq of carrying out a major multipronged attack.MAJ. GEN. AYOUB YUSUF SAID, Peshmerga Commander (through interpreter): I don’t know what is happening exactly, because we have been in this fight since 4:00 in the morning. We have suffered casualties, including martyrs, and now we have withdrawn to this position. Some of the other Kurdish forces have pulled out. They didn’t fire a single shot.LISA DESJARDINS: While Kurdish forces withdrew from posts south of the city, some residents vowed to die fighting. Thousands of others fled north.REBECCA COLLARD: For the last few years, the Iraqi forces, these primarily Shia militia, the Hashed Shaabi, and the Kurdish forces have been focused on fighting ISIS. Now that fight is coming to an end, and what the fear is that now these internal division in Iraq are going to become more apparent and possibly more violent.LISA DESJARDINS: These clashes pit one substantially American-armed military force against another. Both the Kurdish forces and Iraqi government troops are part of the coalition fighting ISIS. The U.S. sought to downplay the fighting, labeling the exchange of gunfire a misunderstanding.And, in the Rose Garden, President Trump tried to stay neutral.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We don’t like the fact that they’re clashing. We’re not taking sides. But we don’t like the fact that they’re clashing.LISA DESJARDINS: For the PBS NewsHour, I’m Lisa Desjardins.JUDY WOODRUFF: For more, I’m joined now by Emma Sky. She served as an adviser to General David Petraeus while he was commander of U.S. forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2010, and by Feisal Istrabadi. He’s a former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations and he helped write Iraq’s interim constitution.Welcome to both of you.Let me start with you, Emma Sky.This has happened so quickly. What exactly has the Iraqi government done?EMMA SKY, Yale University: The Iraqi government has deployed its forces back up north into Kirkuk.And since 2003, the Kurds have made it clear that they want to include Kirkuk within their territory in order to proceed with gaining independence, which has always been their goal. But Kirkuk is important to Iraq itself, and no Iraqi prime minister can afford to lose Kirkuk.So you can see this reaction that has taken place following the referendum on independence, which happened September the 25th, and also included the disputed territories and the city of Kirkuk.JUDY WOODRUFF: Feisal Istrabadi, what can you add to why the Iraqi government is so set on taking over the city?FEISAL ISTRABADI, Former Deputy UN Ambassador, Iraq: Well, a couple of reasons.First, as Emma just said, it is a part of the disputed territories, which are legally and constitutionally under the jurisdiction of the federal government in Baghdad. The KRG expanded into these disputed territories at the time when ISIL was expanding its territory, and then began to take steps to unilaterally declare that these areas were now incorporated into the Kurdistan region, including when it held the referendum that Emma talked about.It included holding the referendum in these disputed territories. Now, so long as Iraq — so long as we’re talking about a single country, it matters a little less who controls Kirkuk, but once the referendum was held, this gave rise then to the second reason for Baghdad choosing to act now.As Emma said, Kirkuk is an important oil-producing zone in Iraq. And it is vital for the economic viability of an independent Kurdish state and an important part of the economic viability of the Iraqi state. So there was never going to be a scenario, I think, in which Baghdad would allow a unilateral exercise of control by Kurds to occur over Kirkuk, so long as independence is on the table.JUDY WOODRUFF: Emma Sky, we heard President Trump say today the U.S. is not taking sides in this.Is that accurate, that the U.S. isn’t taking sides? What is the U.S. role here?EMMA SKY: Well, the U.S. has stipulated over and over again that its policy is to support a united Iraq.So you can see the U.S. has given support to Iraqi security forces, but also to the Kurdish Peshmerga, to fight against ISIS. The U.S. policy for the last few years has really been focused on ISIS and not on the day after ISIS.But what we’re witnessing at the moment is that different groups are already moving to the day after, which is the power struggle for control of different territories in Iraq.And Barzani believed that during the fight against ISIS, he became stronger because he got weapons directly from the international community. And, as Feisal said, he was able to extend his control over the disputed territories.He’s also facing domestic problems within Kurdistan. There are tensions between the different Kurdish groups, and some believe that Barzani has overstayed his term as president.JUDY WOODRUFF: Which reminds us just how complicated this is, Feisal Istrabadi.What does the Iraqi central government want here? They’re not going to get rid of the Kurds. What is it that they want?FEISAL ISTRABADI: Oh, well, I mean, the Kurds of course are a vital part of Iraq. They’re a vital part of the political process, and they have been represented in Baghdad. The president of Iraq is a Kurd and has been since 2005.I think what needs to occur and I hope what the government of Iraq wants is a negotiated settlement, in which no party dictates terms to the other, but a negotiated settlement.Look, Irbil has some legitimate agreements with respect to Baghdad. Baghdad has some legitimate agreements with respect to Irbil. I think we need a mediator perhaps or somebody to convene a roundtable — the United States is who I’m thinking of, of course — to address some of those issues.Most of the issues are, from the Irbil side, economic issues of payments, and from Baghdad’s side, transparency of how much oil Irbil is producing and exporting, which Irbil has never accounted for to Baghdad.I think if those issues are resolved, perhaps hopefully some of these other issues can at least be delayed for another day. But at the end of the day, neither government — neither the regional government nor the federal government in Baghdad can really tolerate dictation of terms to it by the other side. My hope is that a negotiated settlement obtains.JUDY WOODRUFF: Emma Sky, where do you see this going from here? Do you see the peace that different sides have worked to hard to create in Iraq unraveling as a result of this?EMMA SKY: I think there is an opportunity for a deal, and I think the sort of deal that could be negotiated is one that looks at a special status for the city of Kirkuk and negotiated terms for Kurdistan’s separate, whether that be towards confederation or towards independence.But there needs to be negotiation. There needs to be a look at where should the border between Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq actually be, and that requires mediation district by district through those territories.JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know there are other players who are playing an important role here in Iran and Turkey, and this is all very much playing out as we watch, watch it happen in Iraq.Emma Sky, Feisal Istrabadi, thank you very much.FEISAL ISTRABADI: Thank you.EMMA SKY: Thank you.The post Why a power struggle has broken out over Kirkuk appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",16-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/power-struggle-broken-kirkuk/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
154,"Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’","WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the North Korean crisis “will continue until the first bomb drops.”That statement comes despite President Donald Trump’s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with “Little Rocket Man,” a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation’s leader, Kim Jong Un.“I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table. And we have spent substantial time actually perfecting those,” Tillerson told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “But be clear: The president has also made clear to me that he wants this solved diplomatically. He’s not seeking to go to war.”Recent mixed messaging from the top of the U.S. government has raised concerns about the potential for miscalculation amid the increasingly bellicose exchange of words by Trump and the North Korean leader.Trump told the U.N. General Assembly last month that if the U.S. is “forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” Trump also tweeted that Korea’s leadership “won’t be around much longer” if it continued its provocations, a declaration that led the North’s foreign minister to assert that Trump had “declared war on our country.”Tillerson acknowledged during a recent trip to Beijing that the Trump administration was keeping open direct channels of communications with North Korea and probing the North’s willingness to talk. He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions.Soon after, Trump took to Twitter, saying he had told “our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man … Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” Trump offered no further explanation, but he said all military options are on the table for dealing with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.Analysts have speculated about whether the president and his top diplomat were playing “good cop, bad cop” with North Korea, and how China might interpret the confusing signals from Washington. Beijing is the North’s main trading partner, and the U.S. is counting on China to enforce U.N. sanctions.“Rest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way what the American policy towards North Korea (is) or what our actions and efforts are directed at,” Tillerson said.Asked if Trump’s tweets undermined Tillerson, the secretary said: “I think what the president is doing is he’s trying to motivate action on a number of people’s part, in particular the regime in North Korea. I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table and we have spent substantial time perfecting those.”He added that Trump “has made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts, which we are, and I’ve told others those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.”North Korea has launched missiles that potentially can strike the U.S. mainland and recently conducted its largest ever underground nuclear explosion. It has threatened to explode another nuclear bomb above the Pacific.The post Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’ appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",16-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/rex-tillerson-says-continue-diplomacy-north-korea-first-bomb-drops/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
155,"Iraqi, Kurdish forces in standoff, weeks after Kurdish vote for independence","HARI SREENIVASAN: The desire of the Kurds along Iraq’s northern border to govern themselves is receiving more resistance from Iraq’s central government. Iraqi army forces are demanding Kurdish troops withdraw from oil fields and military bases around Kirkuk, a city in the Kurdistan region that voted for independence last month. Kirkuk also has 10% of Iraq’s known oil reserves. Washington Post’s Loveday Morris is in Baghdad covering this standoff joins me now via Skype. First of all the significance of this. Why is it so important?LOVEDAY MORRIS: There’s been a longtime conflict between Baghdad and Kurdistan over these disputed territories. Most significant of which is Kirkuk because of the oil reserves. But the referendum last month has really sharpened these disputes because you have Baghdad opposing independence and so it feels like they have to restate its territorial claims these areas. So that’s why we’re seeing a lot of tension right now. HARI SREENIVASAN: And just to give people a little bit of a brief timeline – Iraqi forces control this area for a while and then in June ISIS took over the area and now it’s kind of back in Kurdish hands?LOVEDAY MORRIS: Right. So in June 2014 Iraq lost control of a lot of the areas and we have this huge collapse in the face of an ISIS offensive. Over 100,000 soldiers fled and Kurdish forces moved in some of these areas – some of them maybe took from ISIS and others just moved into into the vacuum. And so Iraqi forces have been in these areas since June 2014. And that’s their main demand that they return to the areas. HARI SREENIVASAN: What’s the likelihood that this standoff right now turns violent? Into some sort of a civil war?LOVEDAY MORRIS:: I think at this point both sides don’t want violence. Al-Abadi, the prime minister, is really trying to defuse the situation by saying there’s going to be no  military attack. But at the same time there is this buildup of forces so that I think they are trying to, in a way, intimidate the Kurds to withdraw from some areas but they don’t want to see a fight per say. But in this really tense situation there can be a small spark and things can turn violent quite easily.HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank you.

156,"South Sudan civil war causes Africa’s worst refugee crisis","The United Nations says South Sudan’s four-year-old civil war has left half of the nation’s population — 6 million people — in need of humanitarian aid. The conflict began when South Sudan’s army split between factions loyal to President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar. The two men mobilized their respective tribes, the Dinka and the Nuer. The war has caused what is now one of the world’s worst refugee crises.SIMONA FOLTYN: Civil war is emptying huge swaths of South Sudan. The violence has uprooted four million people, including two million who’ve fled to neighboring countries. In the last year, more than a million South Sudanese have poured into northern Uganda alone, crossing makeshift bridges like this one to flee fighting, hunger, and brutal attacks on civilians.SEME LUPAI, REFUGEE: They started fighting very, very severely. So that made us to escape with our properties to this side.SIMONA FOLTYN: When Seme Lupai’s family went to one of the refugee camps, initially, he stayed behind to look after the family’s most precious commodity — their cattle. He hid for a year to escape the violence. The refugees carry whatever they can salvage — mattresses, pots, clothes, notebooks — remnants of once peaceful lives turned upside down. At checkpoints, Ugandan soldiers search their belongings for weapons, before the refugees proceed to reception centers. After entering Uganda, the refugees sign in at small waystations. For many, it’s the first night spent in safety after walking for days to escape fighting. Levi Arike fled with his wife and four children.LEVI ARIKE, REFUGEE: When the gunshots started, we laid under a tree with the whole family, because there was nowhere else to hide. We waited for the fighting to stop, and then we got up and started walking to Uganda.SIMONA FOLTYN: Uganda now shoulders most of the burden of Africa’s biggest refugee crisis, managing a constellation of camps which require food, water, healthcare, and policing. At Imvepi Camp, now home to more than 120,000 South Sudanese, new arrivals receive vaccinations, hot meals, and basic items such as soap and plastic tarps to build a house. The government also gives each refugee family a small plot of land, about a twentieth of an acre, where they can build a tent shelter and grow crops to eat or sell. But the land often proves too rocky for farming.SIMONA FOLTYN, IMVEPI REFUGEE CAMP, NORTHERN UGANDA: After completing the registration process, the new arrivals will receive their plot, to start a new life as refugees in Uganda. While they are safe here, there are many challenges ahead, not least processing the trauma of what they experienced back home.This woman, who we’ll call “Agnes,” agreed to tell us about her harrowing experience. She says four government soldiers from President Salva Kiir’s Dinka tribe stopped her as she was fleeing South Sudan and raped her right in front of her family.AGNES (translated to English): When they started raping me, they told me not to raise alarm, otherwise they would shoot me. Still when I’m sleeping, I’m dreaming of the Dinka, that they are coming to rape me again.SIMONA FOLTYN: How often do you have those dreams?AGNES: Daily, every time I lie down, those dreams come.SIMONA FOLTYN: A recent Human Rights Watch report on South Sudan found “…a clear pattern of government forces unlawfully targeting civilians for killings, rapes, torture…and destruction of property..” The victims are from ethnic groups suspected to support the rebels.AGNES: They are doing it, because they know very well that those soldiers are our brothers. So they do it to punish them..SIMONA FOLTYN: Although the rebels, known as the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, purport to protect local communities, there are also reports of their fighters assaulting civilians near the Ugandan border. Josephine Yanya told us she didn’t feel safe in the presence of either side’s soldiers. Her family and neighbors fled their village after government soldiers killed her uncle.They hid in the mountains only to find themselves under attack again, this time by opposition fighters from the Nuer tribe loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. Yanya says ethnic Nuer soldiers from the SPLA-IO rebel group raped a member of her group and stole her father’s’ cattle.JOSEPHINE YANYA (translated to English): Before we were thinking that the rebels would protect us, but if they are lacking food, they just come and take things by force.SIMONA FOLTYN: With nowhere left to hide, Yanya fled to Uganda with her son.But instead of finding a place to rebuild their lives, they are in limbo. And aid groups don’t have enough food to distribute.JOSEPHINE YANYA (translated to English):We are getting small food rations. I know it won’t be enough even for one month.SIMONA FOLTYN: According to the United Nations, the international community has given less than a-third of the $1.4 billion dollars needed for the refugee response in South Sudan’s neighboring countries. These refugees foresee more hardship and have no idea when they might return home.JOSEPHINE YANYA (translated to English): I’m always praying for peace in South Sudan, and until then, I’ll just stay here.The post South Sudan civil war causes Africa’s worst refugee crisis appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",15-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/south-sudan-civil-war-causes-africas-worst-refugee-crisis/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
157,"Hundreds dead after massive truck bomb strikes Mogadishu","At least 231 people were killed and hundreds more wounded after a massive truck bomb on Saturday struck Somalia’s capital city of Mogadishu. The Somali government has blamed the al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab for the attack, and called it the deadliest ever to hit the nation.The blast took place outside the Safari Hotel, where rescue workers dug through the rubble of collapsed buildings overnight in search of survivors. Witnesses described a devastating scene with large-scale carnage, as doctors worked feverishly to attend to the dead and injured, many badly burned. “The hospital is overwhelmed by both dead and wounded,” Dr. Mohamed Yusuf, the director of Medina hospital located near the blast, told the Associated Press. “We also received people whose limbs were cut away by the bomb. This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past.”Photos and videos of the bombing, which took place on a busy street near a section of the city housing foreign embassies, showed collapsed walls, twisted metal, and sporadic fires spewing smoke. The Qatari government said its embassy was “severely damaged” in the strike. The truck bombing in Mogadishu is the deadliest in conflict-riven Somalia so far.

158,"Column: Why reporting from South Sudan is so difficult — and critically needed","In August, fellow reporter Jason Patinkin and I crossed on foot from northern Uganda into rebel-held South Sudan. Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the world’s most underreported conflicts.Reporting on South Sudan’s war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudan’s government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government. The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. This systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.Journalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.We set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.  Just as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or “footing,” as South Sudanese tend to call it.We took off our shoes and waded through the stream’s chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers we’d have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear. The first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone — but we were about to get a reality check.We had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.“Stop! Who are you and where are you going?” a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.  Instinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the “wrong” rebels? Abucha’s group, called the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.To our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abucha’s hometown.Keeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the country’s pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of “two meters per second” (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass. The upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didn’t cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.The closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldn’t stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and – most strikingly – no civilians.  The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that.The post Column: Why reporting from South Sudan is so difficult — and critically needed appeared first on PBS NewsHour.",15-10-2017,10-10-2024,http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/reporters-notebook-reporting-south-sudan-difficult-critically-needed/,http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld,"Terrorism / Protest / Political Unrest / Riot"
